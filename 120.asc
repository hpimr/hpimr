//== Something to Protect: Draco Malfoy

// 19818
//__A/N: Farewell, Terry Pratchett, 1948-2015. Your characters were an
//inspiration to me, and now I can see how much they taught me about Level 1 and
//Level 3 Character Intelligence: that self-awareness often manifests as humor or
//as genre-savviness; that an inner spark of optimization can shine just as
//brightly through characters who are told (but not shown) to be lowly and
//stupid; that intelligent characters can go along with a spark of goodness and
//light running through a story, rather than cynicism. I wish I could have met
//you, and spoken with you about your methods. You were loved by so many, and
//surely at least one person who would tear apart the foundations of reality to
//bring you back; but your brain is dead and warm now, and so your story ends.__

// 19819
//__Even if the stars should die in heaven,__

// 19820
//__Our sins can never be undone.__

// 19821
//__No single death will be forgiven__

// 19822
//__When fades at last the last lit sun.__

// 19823
//__Then in the cold and silent black__

// 19824
//__As light and matter end,__

// 19825
//__We’ll have ourselves a last look back__

// 19826
//__And toast an absent friend.__

// 19828
//The boy sat in an office near to where the once-Deputy Headmistress had held
//court. His tears had run dry hours ago. Now there was only the waiting to see
//what would become of him, the orphan ward of Hogwarts, whose life and happiness
//lay in the hands of his family’s enemies. The boy had been called to this room,
//and he had come because there was nothing else to do and nowhere else to go.
//Vincent and Gregory had left his side, called back by their mothers for their
//fathers’ hurried funerals. Perhaps the boy should have gone with them, but he
//could not bring himself to do so. He would not have been able to act the part
//of a Malfoy. The feeling of emptiness that filled him up was so profound that
//it left no room even for pretended courtesy.

// 19829
//Everyone was dead.

// 19830
//His father was dead, and his godfather Mr. MacNair, and his fallback godfather
//Mr. Avery. Even Sirius Black, his mother’s cousin, had somehow managed to die,
//and the last remnant of House Black was no friend to any Malfoy.

// 19831
//Everyone was dead.

// 19832
//There came a knock upon the office’s door; and then, when the boy made no
//reply, the door opened, revealing -

// 19833
//“Go away,” Draco Malfoy said to the Boy-Who-Lived. He couldn’t muster any force
//in the words.

// 19834
//“I will soon,” Harry Potter said, as he stepped into the room. “But there’s a
//decision to be made, and only you can make it.”

// 19835
//Draco turned his head toward the wall, because just looking at Harry Potter
//took more energy than he had left in him.

// 19836
//“You have to decide,” Harry said, “what happens to Draco Malfoy after this. I
//don’t mean that in any ominous way. No matter what, you’re still going to grow
//up to be the rich heir of a Noble and Most Ancient House. The thing is,”
//Harry’s voice was wavering now, “the thing is, there’s a horrible truth you
//don’t know, and I keep thinking that if you knew, you’d tell me not to be your
//friend anymore. And I don’t want to stop being your friend. But to just - never
//tell you - and always maintain that lie so I can go on being your friend - I
//can’t do that. It’s also wrong. I don’t… don’t want this anymore, I don’t want
//to be __manipulating__ you. I’ve hurt you too much already.”

// 19837
//__Then stop trying to be my friend, you’re no good at it anyway.__ The
//words rose up into Draco’s consciousness, and were rejected from his lips. He
//felt like he’d mostly lost Harry already, from the games Harry had played with
//their friendship, the lies and manipulations; and yet the thought of going back
//to Slytherin alone, maybe without Vincent and Gregory if their mothers
//terminated the arrangement… Draco didn’t want to do that, he didn’t want to go
//back to Slytherin and live out his life among only people who’d agreed to be
//Sorted into Slytherin House. Draco was barely sensible enough to remember how
//many of his real friends were also friends with Harry, that Padma was a
//Ravenclaw and even Theodore was a Chaotic Lieutenant. All that remained of
//Malfoy House was a tradition, now; and that tradition said it wasn’t clever to
//tell the war’s victor to go away and stop trying to be friends with you.

// 19838
//“All right,” Draco said emptily. “Tell me.”

// 19839
//“That’s what I’m going to do,” Harry said. “And then the Headmistress will come
//in after I leave, and seal away your last half-hour of memory. But before then,
//knowing the whole truth, you’ll get to decide whether you still want to be
//involved with me.” Harry’s voice was shaking. “Um. According to the records I
//was reading through before I came here, the story really began in 1926 with the
//birth of a half-blood wizard named Tom Morfin Riddle. His mother died in
//childbirth, and he grew up in a Muggle orphanage, until his Hogwarts letter was
//brought to him by Professor Dumbledore…”

// 19840
//The Boy-Who-Lived continued speaking, words that slammed into what was left of
//Draco’s mind like falling houses.

// 19841
//__The Dark Lord had been a half-blood. He’d never believed in blood
//purity for a fraction of a second.__

// 19842
//__Tom Riddle had come up with the idea of Lord Voldemort as a bad joke.__

// 19843
//__The Death Eaters had been meant to lose to David Monroe, so Monroe
//could take over.__

// 19844
//__After giving up on that, Tom Riddle had gone on playing Voldemort
//instead of actually trying to win, because he’d liked bossing the Death Eaters
//around.__

// 19845
//__Voldemort used me to try to frame Father for my attempted murder, then
//used me again to go after the Philosopher’s Stone.__ Draco couldn’t remember
//that part, but he’d already been told that he’d been used as a pawn alongside
//Professor Sprout, and that no charges would be filed.

// 19846
//And then the last horror.

// 19847
//“You -” whispered Draco Malfoy. “You -”

// 19848
//“I’m the one who killed your father and all the other Death Eaters last night.
//They’d been told to open fire on me the moment I did anything, so I had to kill
//them in order to have a chance at dealing with Voldemort, who was a danger to
//the entire world.” Harry Potter’s voice was strained. “I didn’t think about you
//and Theodore and Vincent and Gregory, but if I had, I’d have done it anyway. My
//mind managed not to realise until afterwards that Mr. White was Lucius, but if
//I’d realised, I still wouldn’t have risked leaving him alive, in case he knew
//wandless magic. The thought occurred to me long before that it would be pretty
//convenient, in terms of the political landscape, for all the Death Eaters to
//suddenly die. I always thought that the Death Eaters were horrible people, much
//more strongly than I ever let on to you, since the first day we met. But if
//your father hadn’t been there, and I’d had a button that could kill him
//remotely, I wouldn’t have pressed the button just for political reasons. The
//way I feel about what I’ve done, and whether there’s remorse… well, there’s a
//part of me that’s screaming in generic horror about having killed anyone. And
//another part that says that from a moral standpoint, the Death Eaters signed
//away their lives on the day they signed up with Voldemort. They pointed their
//wands at me first, blah blah and so on. But right now I just feel sick about
//what I’ve done to you. Again. I feel like,” Harry Potter’s voice wobbled a bit,
//“everything I do only hurts you, for all my __good intentions,__ that
//you’ve only ever lost things from being around me, so if you tell me to stay
//away entirely from Draco Malfoy after this, then I will. And if you want me to
//try to be your friend for real this time, without ever trying to manipulate you
//again, without ever using you again or risking hurting you again, then I will,
//I swear I will.”

// 19849
//The next Lord Malfoy was crying, openly in front of his enemy, decorum and
//composure abandoned, because he didn’t have anyone left for whose sake he could
//keep it.

// 19850
//A lie.

// 19851
//A lie.

// 19852
//Everything had been a lie, it was all lies piled on top of lies, lies lies lies
//-

// 19853
//“__You__ should die,” Draco forced out. “You should die for having killed
//Father.” The words only filled him with more emptiness, but they had to be
//said.

// 19854
//Harry Potter just shook his head. “And if that’s not an option?”

// 19855
//“You should __hurt.__”

// 19856
//Harry only shook his head again.

// 19857
//The Boy-Who-Lived pressed the Lord Malfoy for his decision.

// 19858
//The Lord Malfoy refused to give it. He couldn’t say it, couldn’t bring himself
//to say it, either way. He didn’t want the war’s victor and their mutual friends
//to abandon him, and he wasn’t going to give Harry the absolution he wanted,
//either.

// 19859
//So Draco Malfoy refused to answer, and then the time of that self’s memory
//ended.

// 19860
//The boy sat in an office near to where the once-Deputy Headmistress had held
//court. His tears had run dry hours ago. Now there was only the waiting to see
//what would become of him, the orphan ward of Hogwarts, whose life and happiness
//lay in the hands of his family’s enemies. The boy had been called to this room,
//and he had come, because there was nothing else to do, and nowhere else to go.
//Vincent and Gregory had left his side, called back by their mothers for their
//fathers’ hurried funerals. Perhaps the boy should have gone with them, but he
//could not bring himself to do so. He would not have been able to act the part
//of a Malfoy. The feeling of emptiness that filled him up was so profound that
//it left no room even for lies.

// 19861
//Everyone was dead.

// 19862
//Everyone was dead, and it had all been futile from the beginning.

// 19863
//There was a knock upon the office door, and then, after a polite pause, it
//opened to reveal Headmistress McGonagall, dressed much as she had dressed when
//she was a Professor. “Mr. Malfoy?” his family’s victorious enemy said. “Please
//come with me.”

// 19864
//Listlessly, Draco rose up, and followed her out of the office. Seeing Harry
//Potter waiting beside her gave him some pause, but then his mind simply shut it
//out.

// 19865
//“Here’s the last thing,” Harry Potter said. “I found it in a folded parchment
//whose outside said that it was the last weapon to be used against House Malfoy,
//telling me not to read any further until the whole war hung in the balance. I
//didn’t want to tell it to you before because I thought it might prejudice your
//decision unfairly. If you were a good person who never killed or lied, but you
//had to do one or the other, which would be worse?”

// 19866
//Draco ignored him and continued in Headmistress McGonagall’s company, leaving
//Harry behind looking sadly after.

// 19867
//They came to the Headmistress’s old office, where she lit her Floo-fire with a
//wave of her wand, said to the green flame “Gringotts travel office” and stepped
//through after a firm glance in his direction.

// 19868
//For lack of any other option, Draco Malfoy followed.

// 19869
//She lay in bed, feeling more listless than usual that morning, awoken too early
//with the Sun just beginning to rise - though the direct sunlight was blocked by
//the skyscrapers that shadowed her house. A faint tinge of hangover gnawed at
//her temples, dried her mouth; she tried to be sparing with the drink (though
//she didn’t know why she bothered) but yesterday she’d felt… even more depressed
//than usual, like she’d lost something, somehow. Not for the first time, not for
//the hundredth time, she thought about moving - to Adelaide, to Perth, maybe to
//Perth Amboy if that was what it took. She always had the sense there was
//somewhere else she ought to be; but while she could live a comfortable life on
//the payments the insurance company made to her, she couldn’t afford luxuries.
//She couldn’t pay to go gallivanting around the world looking for someplace that
//fit her unsatisfied sense of belonging. She’d watched the TV for long enough,
//she’d rented enough travelogues, to know that nowhere the VCR showed her gave
//her any more sense of rightness than Sydney.

// 19870
//She’d felt frozen, stopped in time, ever since the traffic accident that had
//stolen her memories - not just of a dead family that meant nothing to her now,
//but memories like how a stove worked. She suspected, no, she __knew,__
//that whatever her heart was waiting for, whatever key needed to turn inside her
//to make her life begin moving again, it was one more thing she’d lost to that
//runaway minivan. She thought about that almost every morning, trying to guess
//what she was missing, missing, missing from her life and mind.

// 19871
//Somebody rang her doorbell.

// 19872
//She groaned, turning her head far enough to look at the LED alarm clock at the
//side of her bed. 6:31, it said, with the AM dot lit. __Seriously?__ Well,
//that idiot could wait while she staggered out of bed at her own pace, then.

// 19873
//Stagger out of bed she did, ignoring the doorbell as it rang again, as she
//ducked into the bathroom and dressed herself.

// 19874
//She clambered down the stairs, ignoring the ever-nagging sense that someone
//else ought to be answering her door for her. “Who’s there?” she called to the
//closed door; the door had a peephole, but it was fogged over.

// 19875
//“Are you Nancy Manson?” came a woman’s voice, speaking in a precise Scottish
//accent.

// 19876
//“Yes,” she said cautiously.

// 19877
//“__Eunoe,__” spoke the Scottish voice, and Nancy leapt back in shock as a
//flash of light came from the door and __hit __her and…

// 19878
//Nancy swayed, putting a hand to her forehead. Flashes of light just going
//through doors and hitting people, that was… that was… that wasn’t particularly
//surprising…

// 19879
//“Would you please open the door?” said the Scottish woman’s voice. “The war is
//over and your memories should be returning shortly. There’s someone here who
//ought to see you.”

// 19880
//__My memories__ -

// 19881
//Nancy’s head was already feeling clogged, like she was about to start hacking
//something out of her brain, but she managed to reach out and yank the door
//open.

// 19882
//There in front of her was a woman dressed as a __(perfectly normal)__
//witch, from black robes to tall pointed hat -

// 19883
//- and standing beside her a boy, with short white-blonde hair and wearing
  //__(perfectly normal)__ dark robes trimmed in green, staring at her with
//his jaw dropped and eyes wide and beginning to fill with tears.

// 19884
//__Green-trimmed robes and white-blonde hair…__

// 19885
//Something warm stirred in her memory. She felt her heart rising into her throat
//as she realized that the thing that she’d been looking for these past ten years
//might be right in front of her this very instant. Somewhere deep inside her,
//ice was cracking around her heart, the piece of her that had been stopped for
//so long preparing to move once more.

// 19886
//The boy was staring at her, his mouth working soundlessly.

// 19887
//A mysterious name came into her mind, rose to her lips.

// 19888
//“Lucius?” she whispered.
