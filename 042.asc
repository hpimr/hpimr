//== Courage

// 7801
//“__Romantic?__” Hermione said. “They’re both __boys!__”

// 7802
//“Wow,” Daphne said, sounding a little shocked. “You mean Muggles really
//__do__ hate that? I thought that was just something the Death Eaters made
//up.”

// 7803
//“No,” said an older Slytherin girl Hermione didn’t recognize, “it’s true, they
//have to get married in secret, and if they’re ever discovered, they get burned
//at the stake together. And if you’re a girl who thinks it’s romantic, they burn
//you too.”

// 7804
//“That can’t be right!” objected a Gryffindor girl, while Hermione was still
//trying to sort out what to say to that. “There wouldn’t be any Muggle girls
//__left!__”

// 7805
//She’d kept on reading quietly, and Harry Potter had kept on trying to
//apologize, and it had soon dawned on Hermione that Harry had realized, possibly
//for the first time in his life, that he’d done something annoying; and that
//Harry, definitely for the first time in his life, was __terrified__ that
//he’d lost her as a friend; and she’d started to feel (a) guilty and (b) worried
//about the direction Harry’s increasingly desperate offers were going. But she
//still had no idea what sort of apology was appropriate, so she’d said that the
//Ravenclaw girls should vote on it - and this time she wouldn’t fix the outcome,
//though she hadn’t mentioned that part - to which Harry had instantly agreed.

// 7806
//The next day, practically every Ravenclaw girl over the age of thirteen had
//voted to have Draco drop Harry.

// 7807
//Hermione had felt mildly disappointed it was that simple, though it was
//obviously fair.

// 7808
//Right now, however, standing just outside the great doors of the castle amid
//half the female population of Hogwarts, Hermione was beginning to suspect that
//there were __things__ going on here that she did not understand and that
//she desperately hoped neither of her fellow generals ever heard about.

// 7809
//You couldn’t really see the details from up there, just the general fact of a
//sea of expectant female faces.

// 7810
//“You’ve got no idea what this is about, do you?” said Draco, sounding amused.

// 7811
//Harry had read a fair number of books he wasn’t supposed to read, not to
//mention a few __Quibbler__ headlines.

// 7812
//“Boy-Who-Lived gets Draco Malfoy pregnant?” said Harry.

// 7813
//“Okay, you __do__ know what this is about,” said Draco. “I thought Muggles
//hated that?”

// 7814
//“Only the dumb ones,” said Harry. “But, um, aren’t we, uh, a little
//__young?__”

// 7815
//“Not too young for __them,__” said Draco. He snorted. ”__Girls!__”

// 7816
//They silently walked toward the edge of the roof.

// 7817
//“So __I’m__ doing this for revenge on you,” said Draco, “but why are
//__you__ doing this?”

// 7818
//Harry’s mind made a lightning calculation, weighing the factors, whether it was
//too soon…

// 7819
//“Honestly?” said Harry. “Because I meant to have her climb up the icy walls,
//but I __didn’t__ mean to have her fall off the roof. And, um, I kinda
//__did__ feel really awful about that. I mean, I guess I actually did start
//seeing her as my friendly rival after a while. So this is a real apology to
//her, not a plot or anything.”

// 7820
//There was a pause.

// 7821
//Then -

// 7822
//“Yeah,” said Draco. “I understand.”

// 7823
//Harry didn’t smile. It might have been the most difficult nonsmile of his life.

// 7824
//Draco looked at the edge of the roof, and made a face. “This is going to be a
//lot harder to do on purpose than by accident, isn’t it.”

// 7825
//Harry’s other hand held the roof in a reflexively terrified grip, his fingers
//white on the cold, cold stone.

// 7826
//You could know with your conscious mind that you’d drunk the Feather-Falling
//Potion. Knowing it with your unconscious mind was another matter entirely.

// 7827
//It was every bit as scary as Harry had thought it might have been for Hermione,
//which was justice.

// 7828
//“Draco,” said Harry, controlling his voice wasn’t easy, but the Ravenclaw girls
//had given them a script, “You’ve got to let me go!”

// 7829
//“Okay!” said Draco, and let go of Harry’s arm.

// 7830
//Harry’s other hand scrabbled at the edge, and then, without any decision being
//made, his fingers failed, and Harry fell.

// 7831
//There was a brief moment when Harry’s stomach tried to leap up into his throat,
//and his body tried desperately to orient itself in the absence of any possible
//way to do so.

// 7832
//There was a brief moment when Harry could feel the Feather-Falling Potion
//kicking in, starting to slow him, a sort of lurching, cushioning feeling.

// 7833
//And then something __pulled__ on Harry and he accelerated downward again
//__faster than gravity -__

// 7834
//Harry’s mouth had already opened and begun screaming while part of his brain
//tried to think of something creative he could do, part of his brain tried to
//calculate how much time he had left to be creative, and a tiny rump part of his
//brain noticed that he wasn’t even going to finish the remaining-time
//calculation before he hit the ground -

// 7835
//Harry was desperately trying to control his hyperventilating, and it wasn’t
//helping him to hear the shrieking of all the girls, now lying in heaps on the
//ground and each other.

// 7836
//“Good heavens,” said the unfamiliar man, he of the old-looking clothes and
//faintly scarred face, who was holding Harry in his arms. “Of all the ways I
//imagined we might meet again someday, I didn’t expect it to be you falling out
//of the sky.”

// 7837
//Harry remembered the last thing he’d seen, the falling body, and managed to
//gasp, “Professor… Quirrell…”

// 7838
//“He’ll be all right after a few hours,” said the unfamiliar man holding Harry.
//“He’s just exhausted. I wouldn’t have thought it possible… he must have knocked
//down __two hundred students__ just to make sure he got whoever was jinxing
//you…”

// 7839
//Gently, the man set Harry upright on the ground, supporting him the while.

// 7840
//Harry carefully balanced himself, and nodded to the man.

// 7841
//He let go, and Harry promptly fell over.

// 7842
//The man helped him rise again. Making sure, at all times, to stand between
//Harry and the girls now picking themselves up from the ground, his head
//constantly glancing in that direction.

// 7843
//“Harry,” the man said quietly, and very seriously, “do you have any idea which
//of these girls might have wanted to kill you?”

// 7844
//“Not murder,” said a strained voice. “Just stupidity.”

// 7845
//This time it was the unfamiliar man who seemed to almost fall over, utter shock
//on his face.

// 7846
//Professor Quirrell was already sitting up from where he’d fallen on the grass.

// 7847
//“Good heavens!” gasped the man. “You shouldn’t be -”

// 7848
//“Mr. Lupin, your concerns are misplaced. No wizard, no matter how powerful,
//casts such a Charm by strength alone. You must do it by being
//__efficient.__”

// 7849
//Professor Quirrell didn’t stand up, though.

// 7850
//“Thank you,” Harry whispered. And then, “Thank you,” to the man standing beside
//him as well.

// 7851
//“What happened?” said the man.

// 7852
//“I should have foreseen it myself,” Professor Quirrell said, his voice crisp
//with disapproval. “Some number of girls tried to summon Mr. Potter to their
//own, particular arms. Individually, I suppose, they all thought they were being
//gentle.”

// 7853
//Oh.

// 7854
//“Consider it a lesson in preparedness, Mr. Potter,” said Professor Quirrell.
//“Had I not __insisted__ that there be more than one adult witness to this
//little event, and that __both__ of us have our wands out, Mr. Lupin would
//not have been available to slow your fall afterward, and you would have been
//gravely injured.”

// 7855
//“__Sir!__” said the man - Mr. Lupin, apparently. “You should not say such
//things to the boy!”

// 7856
//“Who is -” Harry started to say.

// 7857
//“The only other person who was available to watch, besides myself,” said
//Professor Quirrell. “I introduce you to Remus Lupin, who is here temporarily to
//instruct students in the Patronus Charm. Though I am told that the two of you
//have already met.”

// 7858
//Harry studied the man, puzzled. He should have remembered that faintly scarred
//face, that strange, gentle smile.

// 7859
//“Where did we meet?” said Harry.

// 7860
//“In Godric’s Hollow,” said the man. “I changed a number of your nappies.”

// 7861
//Mr. Lupin’s temporary office was a small stone room with a small wooden desk,
//and Harry couldn’t see anything of what Mr. Lupin was sitting on, suggesting
//that it was a small stool just like the one in front of his desk. Harry guessed
//that Mr. Lupin wouldn’t be at Hogwarts for long, or use this office much, and
//so he’d told the house elves not to waste the effort. It said something about a
//person that he tried not to bother house elves. Specifically, it said that he’d
//been Sorted into Hufflepuff, since, to the best of Harry’s knowledge, Hermione
//was the only non-Hufflepuff who worried about bothering house elves. (Harry
//himself thought her qualms rather silly. Whoever had created house elves in the
//first place had been unspeakably evil, obviously; but that didn’t mean Hermione
//was doing the right thing __now__ by denying sentient beings the drudgery
//they had been shaped to enjoy.)

// 7862
//“Please sit down, Harry,” the man said quietly. His formal robes were of low
//quality, not quite tattered, but visibly worn by the passage of time in a way
//that simple Repair Charms couldn’t fix; __shabby__ was the word that came
//to mind. And despite that, somehow, there was a dignity about him that couldn’t
//have been obtained by fine and expensive robes, that wouldn’t have __fit__
//with fine robes, that was the exclusive property of the shabby. Harry had
//__heard__ of humility, but he’d never seen the real thing before - only
//the satisfied modesty of people who thought it was part of their style and
//wanted you to notice.

// 7863
//Harry took a seat on the small wooden stool in front of Mr. Lupin’s short desk.

// 7864
//“Thank you for coming,” the man said.

// 7865
//“No, thank __you__ for saving me,” said Harry. “Let me know if you ever
//need something impossible done.”

// 7866
//The man seemed to hesitate. “Harry, may I… ask a personal question?”

// 7867
//“You can ask, certainly,” Harry said. “I have a lot of questions for you, too.”

// 7868
//Mr. Lupin nodded. “Harry, are your stepparents treating you well?”

// 7869
//“My __parents__,” Harry said. “I have four. Michael, James, Petunia, and
//Lily.”

// 7870
//“Ah,” said Mr. Lupin. And then, “Ah” again. He seemed to be blinking rather
//hard. “I… that is good to hear, Harry, Dumbledore would tell none of us where
//you were… I was afraid he might think you ought to have wicked stepparents, or
//some such… ”

// 7871
//Harry wasn’t sure Mr. Lupin’s concern had been misplaced, considering his own
//first encounter with Dumbledore; but it had all turned out well enough, so he
//said nothing. “What about my…” Harry searched for a word that didn’t raise them
//higher or put them lower… “__other__ parents? I want to know, well,
//everything.”

// 7872
//“A tall order,” Mr. Lupin said. He wiped a hand across his forehead. “Well, let
//us begin at the beginning. When you were born, James was so happy that he
//couldn’t touch his wand without it glowing gold, for a whole week. And even
//after that, whenever he held you, or saw Lily holding you, or just thought of
//you, it would happen again -”

// 7873
//Every now and then Harry would look at his watch, and find that another thirty
//minutes had passed. He felt slightly bad about making Remus miss dinner,
//especially since Harry himself would just drop back to 7pm later, but that
//wasn’t enough to stop either of them.

// 7874
//Finally Harry screwed up enough courage to ask the critical question, while
//Remus was in the middle of an extended discourse on the wonders of James’s
//Quidditch that Harry couldn’t find the heart to squash more directly.

// 7875
//“And that was when,” Remus said, his eyes shining brightly, “James pulled off a
//__triple reverse Mulhanney Dive__ with __extra backspin!__ The whole
//crowd went wild, even some of the Hufflepuffs were cheering -”

// 7876
//__I guess you had to be there,__ Harry thought - not that being there
//would have helped in any way - and said, “Mr. Lupin?”

// 7877
//Something about Harry’s voice must have reached the man, because he stopped in
//mid-sentence.

// 7878
//“Was my father a bully?” said Harry.

// 7879
//Remus looked at Harry for a long moment. “For a little while,” Remus said. “He
//grew out of it soon enough. Where did you hear that?”

// 7880
//Harry didn’t answer, he was trying to think of something true to say that would
//deflect suspicion, but he didn’t think fast enough.

// 7881
//“Never mind,” said Remus, and sighed. “I can guess who.” The faintly scarred
//face was pinched in disapproval. “What a thing to tell -”

// 7882
//“Did my father have any extenuating circumstances?” Harry said. “Poor home
//life, or something like that? Or was he just… being naturally nasty?”__
//Cold?__

// 7883
//Remus’s hand swept his hair back, the first nervous gesture Harry had seen from
//him. “Harry,” Remus said, “you can’t judge your father by what he did as a
//young boy!”

// 7884
//“__I’m__ a young boy,” Harry said, “and I judge __myself.__”

// 7885
//Remus blinked twice at that.

// 7886
//“I want to know __why__,” Harry said. “I want to __understand__,
//because to me, it seems like there isn’t any possible excuse for that!” Voice
//shaking a bit. “Please tell me anything you know about why he did it, even if
//it doesn’t sound nice.” __ So I don’t fall into the same trap myself,
//whatever it is.__

// 7887
//“It was the thing to do if you were in Gryffindor,” Remus said, slowly,
//reluctantly. “And… I didn’t think so back then, I thought it was the other way
//around, but… it might have been __Black__ who got __James__ into it,
//really… Black wanted so much to show everyone that he was against Slytherin,
//you see, we all wanted to believe that blood wasn’t destiny -”

// 7888
//“No, Harry,” said Remus. “I don’t know why Black went after Peter instead of
//running. It was as though Black was making tragedy for the sake of tragedy that
//day.” The man’s voice was unsteady. “There was no hint, no warning, we all
//thought - to think that he was to be -” Remus’s voice cut off.

// 7889
//Harry was crying, he couldn’t help it, it hurt worse to hear it from Remus than
//anything he’d ever felt himself. Harry had lost two parents he didn’t remember,
//knew only from stories. Remus Lupin had lost all four of his best friends in
//less than twenty-four hours; and for the loss of his last remaining one, Peter
//Pettigrew, there’d just been no reason at all.

// 7890
//“Sometimes it still hurts to think of him in Azkaban,” Remus finished, his
//voice almost a whisper. “I am glad, Harry, that Death Eaters are not allowed
//visitors. It means I do not have to feel ashamed of not going.”

// 7891
//Harry had to swallow hard several times before he could speak. “Can you tell me
//about Peter Pettigrew? He was my father’s friend, and it seems - that I should
//know, that I should remember -”

// 7892
//Remus nodded, water glittering in his own eyes now. “I think, Harry, that if
//Peter had known it would end that way -” the man’s voice choked up. “Peter was
//more afraid of the Dark Lord than any of us, and if he’d known it would end
//that way, I don’t think he would have done it. But Peter knew the
//__risk__, Harry, he knew the risk was real, that it __could__ happen,
//and yet he stayed by James and Lily’s side. All through Hogwarts I used to
//wonder why Peter hadn’t been sorted into Slytherin, or maybe Ravenclaw, because
//Peter so adored secrets, he couldn’t resist them, he would find out things
//about people, things they wanted kept hidden -” A brief wry look crossed
//Remus’s face. “But he didn’t __use__ those secrets, Harry. He just wanted
//to know. And then the Dark Lord’s shadow fell over everything, and Peter stood
//by James and Lily and put his talents to good use, and I understood why the Hat
//had sent him to Gryffindor.” Remus’s voice was fierce now, and proud. “It’s
//__easy__ to stand by your friends if you’re a hero like Godric, bold and
//strong like people think Gryffindors should be. But if Peter was more afraid
//than any of us, doesn’t that also make him the most brave?”

// 7893
//“It does,” Harry said. His own voice was choked to where he almost couldn’t
//talk. “If you could, Mr. Lupin, if you have time, there’s someone else who I
//think should hear Peter Pettigrew’s story, a student in first-year Hufflepuff,
//named Neville Longbottom.”

// 7894
//“Alice and Frank’s boy,” said Remus, his voice turning sad. “I see. It is not a
//happy story, Harry, but I can tell it again, if you think it will help him.”

// 7895
//Harry nodded.

// 7896
//A brief silence fell.

// 7897
//“Did Black have __any__ unfinished business with Peter Pettigrew?” Harry
//said. “__Anything__ that would make him seek out Mr. Pettigrew, even if it
//wasn’t a killing matter? Like a secret Mr. Pettigrew knew, that Black wanted to
//know himself, or wanted to kill him to hide?”

// 7898
//Something flickered in Remus’s eyes, but the older man shook his head, and
//said, “Not really.”

// 7899
//“That means there __is__ something,” said Harry.

// 7900
//That wry smile appeared again beneath the salt-and-pepper mustache. “You have a
//bit of Peter in you yourself, I see. But it’s not important, Harry.”

// 7901
//“I’m a Ravenclaw, I’m not __supposed__ to resist the temptation of
//secrets. And,” Harry said more seriously, “if it was worth Black getting
//caught, I can’t help but think it might matter.”

// 7902
//Remus looked quite uncomfortable. “I suppose I could tell you when you’re
//older, but really, Harry, it’s __not__ important! Just something from our
//school days.”

// 7903
//Harry couldn’t have put his finger on exactly what tipped him off; it might
//have been something about the exact tone of nervousness in Remus’s voice, or
//the way the man had said __when you’re older__, that sparked the sudden
//leap of Harry’s intuition…

// 7904
//“Actually,” said Harry, “I think I’ve sort of guessed it already, sorry.”

// 7905
//Remus raised his eyebrows. “Have you?” He sounded a bit skeptical.

// 7906
//“They were lovers, weren’t they?”

// 7907
//There was an awkward pause.

// 7908
//Remus gave a slow, grave nod.

// 7909
//“Once,” Remus said. “A long time ago. A sad affair, ending in vast tragedy, or
//so it seemed to us all when we were young.” The unhappy puzzlement was plain on
//his face. “But I had thought that long since over and done and buried beneath
//adult friendship, until the day that Black killed Peter.”
