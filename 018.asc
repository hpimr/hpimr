//== Dominance Hierarchies

// 2977
//Any sufficiently advanced J. K. Rowling is indistinguishable from magic.

// 2978
//__“That does sound like the sort of thing I would do, doesn’t it?”__

// 2979
//It was breakfast time on Friday morning. Harry took another huge bite out of
//his toast and then tried to remind his brain that scarfing his breakfast
//wouldn’t actually get him into the dungeons any faster. Anyway they had a full
//hour of study time between breakfast and the start of Potions.

// 2980
//But dungeons! In Hogwarts! Harry’s imagination was already sketching the
//chasms, narrow bridges, torchlit sconces, and patches of glowing moss. Would
//there be rats? Would there be __dragons?__

// 2981
//“Harry Potter,” said a quiet voice from behind him.

// 2982
//Harry looked over his shoulder and found himself beholding Ernie Macmillan,
//smartly dressed in yellow-trimmed robes and looking a little worried.

// 2983
//“Neville thought I should warn you,” Ernie said in a low voice. “I think he’s
//right. Be careful of the Potions Master in our session today. The older
//Hufflepuffs told us that Professor Snape can be really nasty to people he
//doesn’t like, and he doesn’t like most people who aren’t Slytherins. If you say
//anything smart to him it… it could be really bad for you, from what I’ve heard.
//Just keep your head down and don’t give him any reason to notice you.”

// 2984
//There was a pause as Harry processed this, and then he lifted his eyebrows.
//(Harry wished he could raise just one eyebrow, like Spock, but he’d never been
//able to manage.) “Thanks,” Harry said. “You might’ve just saved me a lot of
//trouble.”

// 2985
//Ernie nodded, and turned to go back to the Hufflepuff table.

// 2986
//Harry resumed eating his toast.

// 2987
//It was around four bites afterward that someone said “Pardon me,” and Harry
//turned around to see an older Ravenclaw, looking a little worried -

// 2988
//Some time later, Harry was finishing up his third plate of rashers. (He’d
//learned to eat heavily at breakfast. He could always eat lightly at lunch if he
//didn’t end up using the Time-Turner.) And there was yet another voice from
//behind him saying “Harry?”

// 2989
//“Yes,” Harry said wearily, “I’ll try not to draw Professor Snape’s attention -”

// 2990
//“Oh, that’s hopeless,” said Fred.

// 2991
//“Completely hopeless,” said George.

// 2992
//“So we had the house elves bake you a cake,” said Fred.

// 2993
//“We’re going to put one candle on it for every point you lose for Ravenclaw,”
//said George.

// 2994
//“And have a party for you at the Gryffindor table during lunch,” said Fred.

// 2995
//“We hope that’ll cheer you up afterward,” finished George.

// 2996
//Harry swallowed his last bite of rasher and turned around. “All right,” said
//Harry. “I wasn’t going to ask this after Professor Binns, I really wasn’t, but
//if Professor Snape is __that__ awful why hasn’t he been fired?”

// 2997
//“Fired?” said Fred.

// 2998
//“You mean, let go?” said George.

// 2999
//“Yes,” Harry said. “It’s what you do to bad teachers. You fire them. Then you
//hire a better teacher instead. You don’t have unions or tenure here, right?”

// 3000
//Fred and George were frowning in much the same way that hunter-gatherer tribal
//elders might frown if you tried to tell them about calculus.

// 3001
//“I don’t know,” said Fred after a while. “I never thought about that.”

// 3002
//“Me neither,” said George.

// 3003
//“Yeah,” said Harry, “I get that a lot. See you at lunch, guys, and don’t blame
//me if there aren’t any candles on that cake.”

// 3004
//Fred and George both laughed, as if Harry had said something funny, and bowed
//to him and headed back toward Gryffindor.

// 3005
//Harry turned back to the breakfast table and grabbed a cupcake. His stomach
//already felt full, but he had a feeling this morning might use a lot of
//calories.

// 3006
//As he ate his cupcake, Harry thought of the worst teacher he’d met so far,
//Professor Binns of History. Professor Binns was a ghost. From what Hermione had
//said about ghosts, it didn’t seem likely that they were fully self-aware. There
//were no famous discoveries made by ghosts, or much of any original work, no
//matter who they’d been in life. Ghosts tended to have trouble remembering the
//current century. Hermione had said they were like accidental portraits,
//impressed into the surrounding matter by a burst of psychic energy accompanying
//a wizard’s sudden death.

// 3007
//Harry had run into some stupid teachers during his abortive forays into
//standard Muggle education - his father had been a lot pickier when it came to
//selecting grad students as tutors, of course - but History class was the first
//time he’d encountered a teacher who literally wasn’t sentient.

// 3008
//And it showed, too. Harry had given up after five minutes and started reading a
//textbook. When it became clear that “Professor Binns” wasn’t going to object,
//Harry had also reached into his pouch and gotten earplugs.

// 3009
//Did ghosts not require a salary? Was that it? Or was it literally impossible to
//fire anyone in Hogwarts __even if they died?__

// 3010
//Now it seemed that Professor Snape was going about being absolutely awful to
//everyone who wasn’t a Slytherin and it hadn’t even __occurred__ to anyone
//to terminate his contract.

// 3011
//And the Headmaster had set fire to a chicken.

// 3012
//“Excuse me,” came a worried voice from behind him.

// 3013
//“I swear,” Harry said without turning around, “this place is almost eight and a
//half percent as bad as what Dad says about Oxford.”

// 3014
//Harry stamped down the stone corridors, looking affronted, annoyed, and
//infuriated all at once.

// 3015
//“Dungeons!” Harry hissed. “__Dungeons! __ These are not dungeons! This is
//a basement! A __basement!__”

// 3016
//Some of the Ravenclaw girls gave him odd looks. The boys were all used to him
//by now.

// 3017
//It seemed that the level in which the Potions classroom was located was called
//the “dungeons” for no better reason than that it was below ground and slightly
//colder than the main castle.

// 3018
//In __Hogwarts!__ In __Hogwarts!__ Harry had been waiting his whole
//life and now he was __still__ waiting and if there was anywhere __on
//the face of the Earth__ that had decent dungeons it ought to be Hogwarts! Was
//Harry going to have to build his own castle if he wanted to see one little
//bottomless abyss?

// 3019
//A short time later they got to the actual Potions classroom and Harry cheered
//up considerably.

// 3020
//The Potions classroom had strange preserved creatures floating in huge jars on
//shelves that covered every centimeter of wall space between the closets. Harry
//had gotten far enough along in his reading now that he could actually identify
//some of the creatures, like the Zabriskan Fontema. Albeit the fifty-centimeter
//spider __looked__ like an Acromantula but it was too small to __be__
//one. He’d tried asking Hermione, but she hadn’t seemed very interested in
//looking anywhere near where he was pointing.

// 3021
//Harry was looking at a large dust ball with eyes and feet when the assassin
//swept into the room.

// 3022
//That was the first thought that crossed Harry’s mind when he saw Professor
//Severus Snape. There was something quiet and deadly about the way the man
//stalked between the children’s desks. His robes were unkempt, his hair spotted
//and greasy. There was something about him that seemed reminiscent of Lucius,
//although the two of them looked nothing remotely alike, and you got the
//impression that where Lucius would kill you with flawless elegance, this man
//would simply kill you.

// 3023
//“Sit down,” said Professor Severus Snape. “Now.”

// 3024
//Harry and a few other children who had been standing around talking to each
//other scrambled for desks. Harry had planned on ending up next to Hermione but
//somehow he found himself sitting down in the nearest empty desk next to Justin
//Finch-Fletchley (it was a Doubles session, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff) which put
//him two desks to the left of Hermione.

// 3025
//Severus seated himself behind the teacher’s desk, and without the slightest
//transition or introduction, said, “Hannah Abbott.”

// 3026
//“Here,” said Hannah in a somewhat trembling voice.

// 3027
//“Susan Bones.”

// 3028
//“Present.”

// 3029
//And so it went, no one daring to say a word in edgewise, until:

// 3030
//“Ah, yes. Harry Potter. Our new… __celebrity.__”

// 3031
//“The celebrity is present, __sir__.”

// 3032
//Half the class flinched, and some of the smarter ones suddenly looked like they
//wanted to run out the door while the classroom was still there.

// 3033
//Severus smiled in an anticipatory sort of way and called the next name on his
//list.

// 3034
//Harry gave a mental sigh. That had happened way too fast for him to do anything
//about it. Oh well. Clearly this man already didn’t like him, for whatever
//reason. And when Harry thought about it, better by far that this Potions
//professor should pick on __him__ rather than, say, Neville or Hermione.
//Harry was a lot better able to defend himself. Yep, probably all for the best.

// 3035
//When full attendance had been taken, Severus swept his gaze over the full
//class. His eyes were as empty as a night sky without stars.

// 3036
//“You are here,” Severus said in a quiet voice which the students at back
//strained to hear, “to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking.
//As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe
//this is magic. I don’t expect you will really understand the beauty of the
//softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of
//liquids that creep through human veins,” this in a rather caressing, gloating
//tone, “bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses,” this was just getting
//creepier and creepier. “I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even
//stopper death - if you aren’t as great a pack of fools as I usually have to
//teach.”

// 3037
//Severus somehow seemed to notice the look of skepticism on Harry’s face, or at
//least his eyes suddenly jumped to where Harry was sitting.

// 3038
//“Potter!” snapped the Potions professor. “What would I get if I added powdered
//root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?”

// 3039
//Harry blinked. “Was that in __Magical Drafts and Potions__?” he said. “I
//just finished reading it, and I don’t remember anything which used wormwood -”

// 3040
//Hermione’s hand went up and Harry shot her a glare which caused her to raise
//her hand even higher.

// 3041
//“Tut, tut,” Severus said silkily. “Fame clearly isn’t everything.”

// 3042
//“Really?” Harry said. “But you just told us you’d teach us how to bottle fame.
//Say, how __does__ that work, exactly? You drink it and turn into a
//celebrity?”

// 3043
//Three-quarters of the class flinched.

// 3044
//Hermione’s hand was dropping slowly back down. Well, that wasn’t surprising.
//She might be his rival, but she wasn’t the sort of girl who would play along
//after it became clear that the professor was deliberately trying to humiliate
//him.

// 3045
//Harry was trying hard to keep control of his temper. The first rejoinder that
//had crossed his mind was ‘Abracadabra’.

// 3046
//“Let’s try again,” said Severus. “Potter, where would you look if I told you to
//find me a bezoar?”

// 3047
//“That’s not in the textbook either,” Harry said, “but in one Muggle book I read
//that a trichinobezoar is a mass of solidified hair found in a human stomach,
//and Muggles used to believe it would cure any poison -”

// 3048
//“Wrong,” Severus said. “A bezoar is found in the stomach of a goat, it is not
//made of hair, and it will cure most poisons but not all.”

// 3049
//“I didn’t __say__ it would, I said that was what I read in one Muggle book
//-”

// 3050
//“No one here is interested in your __pathetic__ Muggle books. Final try.
//What is the difference, Potter, between monksblood and wolfsbane?”

// 3051
//That did it.

// 3052
//“You know,” Harry said icily, “in one of my quite __fascinating__ Muggle
//books, they describe a study in which people managed to make themselves look
//very smart by asking questions about random facts that only they knew.
//Apparently the onlookers only noticed that the askers knew and the answerers
//didn’t, and failed to adjust for the unfairness of the underlying game. So,
//Professor, can you tell me how many electrons are in the outermost orbital of a
//carbon atom?”

// 3053
//Severus’s smile widened. “Four,” he said. “It is a useless fact which no one
//should bother writing down, however. And for your information, Potter, asphodel
//and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of
//Living Death. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which
//also goes by the name of aconite, as you would know if you had read __One
//Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi.__ Thought you didn’t need to open the book
//before coming, eh, Potter? All the rest of you should be copying that down so
//that you will not be as ignorant as him.” Severus paused, looking quite pleased
//with himself. “And that will be… five points? No, let us make it an even ten
//points from Ravenclaw for backchat.”

// 3054
//Hermione gasped, along with a number of others.

// 3055
//“Professor Severus Snape,” Harry bit out. “I know of nothing which I have done
//to earn your enmity. If there is some problem you have with me which I do not
//know about, I suggest we -”

// 3056
//“Shut up, Potter. Ten more points from Ravenclaw. The rest of you, open your
//books to page 3.”

// 3057
//There was only a slight, only a very faint burning sensation in the back of
//Harry’s throat, and no moisture at all in his eyes. If crying was not an
//effective strategy for destroying this Potions professor then there was no
//point in crying.

// 3058
//Slowly, Harry sat up very straight. All his blood seemed to have been drained
//away and replaced with liquid nitrogen. He knew he’d been trying to keep his
//temper but he couldn’t seem to remember why.

// 3059
//“Harry,” whispered Hermione frantically from two desks over, “stop, please,
//it’s all right, we won’t count it -”

// 3060
//“Talking in class, Granger? Three -”

// 3061
//“So,” said a voice colder than zero Kelvin, “how does one go about filing a
//formal complaint against an abusive professor? Does one talk to the Deputy
//Headmistress, write a letter to the Board of Governors… would you care to
//explain how it works?”

// 3062
//The class was utterly frozen.

// 3063
//“Detention for one month, Potter,” Severus said, smiling even more broadly.

// 3064
//“I decline to recognize your authority as a teacher and I will not serve any
//detention you give.”

// 3065
//People stopped breathing.

// 3066
//Severus’s smile vanished. “Then you will be -” his voice stopped short.

// 3067
//“Expelled, were you about to say?” Harry, on the other hand, was now smiling
//thinly. “But then you seemed to doubt your ability to carry out the threat, or
//fear the consequences if you did. I, on the other hand, neither doubt nor fear
//the prospect of finding a school with less abusive professors. Or perhaps I
//should hire private tutors, as is my accustomed practice, and be taught at my
//full learning speed. I have enough money in my vault. Something about bounties
//on a Dark Lord I defeated. But there __are__ teachers at Hogwarts who I
//rather like, so I think it will be easier if I find some way to get rid of you
//instead.”

// 3068
//“Get rid of me?” Severus said, now also smiling thinly. “What an amusing
//conceit. How do you suppose you will do that, Potter?”

// 3069
//“I understand there have been a number of complaints about you from students
//and their parents,” a guess but a safe one, “which leaves only the question of
//why you’re not already gone. Is Hogwarts too financially strapped to afford a
//real Potions professor? I could chip in, if so. I’m sure they could find a
//better class of teacher if they offered double your current salary.”

// 3070
//Two poles of ice radiated freezing winter across the classroom.

// 3071
//“You will find,” Severus said softly, “that the Board of Governers is not the
//slightest bit sympathetic to your offer.”

// 3072
//“Lucius…” Harry said. “__That’s__ why you’re still here. Perhaps I should
//chat with Lucius about that. I believe he desires to meet with me. I wonder if
//I have anything he wants?”

// 3073
//Hermione frantically shook her head. Harry noticed out of the corner of his
//eye, but his attention was all on Severus.

// 3074
//“You are a very foolish boy,” Severus said. He wasn’t smiling at all, now. “You
//have nothing that Lucius values more than my friendship. And if you did, I have
//other allies.” His voice grew hard. “And I find it increasingly unlikely that
//you were not Sorted into Slytherin. How was it that you managed to stay out of
//my House? Ah, yes, because the Sorting Hat claimed it was __joking__. For
//the first time in recorded history. What were you really __chatting__
//about with the Sorting Hat, Potter? Did you have something that it wanted?”

// 3075
//Harry stared into Severus’s cold gaze and remembered that the Sorting Hat had
//warned him not to meet anyone’s eyes while thinking about - Harry dropped his
//gaze to Severus’s desk.

// 3076
//“You seem oddly reluctant to look me in the eyes, Potter!”

// 3077
//A shock of sudden understanding - “So it was __you__ the Sorting Hat was
//warning me about!”

// 3078
//“What?” said Severus’s voice, sounding genuinely surprised, though of course
//Harry didn’t look at his face.

// 3079
//Harry got up out of his desk.

// 3080
//“Sit down, Potter,” said an angry voice from somewhere he wasn’t looking.

// 3081
//Harry ignored it, and looked around the classroom. “I have no intention of
//letting one unprofessional teacher ruin my time at Hogwarts,” Harry said with
//deadly calm. “I think I’ll take my leave of this class, and either hire a tutor
//to teach me Potions while I’m here, or if the Board is really that locked up,
//learn over the summer. If any of you decide that you don’t care to be bullied
//by this man, my sessions will be open to you.”

// 3082
//“__Sit down, Potter!__”

// 3083
//Harry strode across the room and grasped the doorknob.

// 3084
//It didn’t turn.

// 3085
//Harry slowly turned around, and caught a glimpse of Severus smiling nastily
//before he remembered to look away.

// 3086
//“Open this door.”

// 3087
//“No,” said Severus.

// 3088
//“You are making me feel threatened,” said a voice so icy it didn’t sound like
//Harry’s at all, “and that is a mistake.”

// 3089
//Severus’s voice laughed. “What do you intend to do about it, little boy?”

// 3090
//Harry took six long strides forward away from the door, until he was standing
//near the back row of desks.

// 3091
//Then Harry drew himself upright and raised his right hand in one terrible
//motion, fingers poised to snap.

// 3092
//Neville screamed and dived under his desk. Other children shrank back or
//instinctively raised their arms to shield themselves.

// 3093
//“__Harry don’t!__” shrieked Hermione. “Whatever you were going to do to
//him, don’t do it!”

// 3094
//“Have you all gone __mad?__” barked Severus’s voice.

// 3095
//Slowly, Harry lowered his hand. “I wasn’t going to hurt him, Hermione,” Harry
//said, his voice a little lower. “I was just going to blow up the door.”

// 3096
//Though now that Harry remembered it, you weren’t supposed to Transfigure things
//that were to be burned, which meant that going back in time afterward and
//getting Fred or George to Transfigure some carefully measured amount of
//explosives might not actually have been such a good idea…

// 3097
//“__Silencio,__” said Severus’s voice.

// 3098
//Harry tried to say “What?” and found that no sound was coming out.

// 3099
//“This has become ridiculous. I think you’ve been allowed to get yourself in
//enough trouble for one day, Potter. You are the most disruptive and unruly
//student I have ever seen, and I don’t recall how many points Ravenclaw has
//right now, but I’m sure I can manage to wipe them all out. Ten points from
//Ravenclaw. Ten points from Ravenclaw. Ten points from Ravenclaw! Fifty points
//from Ravenclaw! Now sit down and watch the rest of the class take their
//lesson!”

// 3100
//Harry put his hand into his pouch and tried to say ‘marker’ but of course no
//words came out. For one brief moment that stopped him; and then it occurred to
//Harry to spell out M-A-R-K-E-R using finger motions, which worked. P-A-D and he
//had a pad of paper. Harry strode over to an empty desk, not the one he’d
//originally sat down in, and scrawled a brief message. He tore off that sheet of
//paper, put away the marker and pad in a pocket of his robes for quicker access,
//and held up his message, not to Snape, but to the rest of the class.

// 3101
//I’M LEAVING

// 3102
//DOES ANYONE ELSE

// 3103
//NEED TO GET OUT?

// 3104
//“You’re insane, Potter,” Severus said with cold contempt.

// 3105
//Aside from that, no one spoke.

// 3106
//Harry swept an ironic bow to the teacher’s desk, walked over to the wall, and
//with one smooth motion yanked open a closet door, stepped in, and slammed the
//door shut behind him.

// 3107
//There was the muffled sound of someone snapping his fingers, and then nothing.

// 3108
//In the classroom, students looked at each other in puzzlement and fear.

// 3109
//The Potions Master’s face was now completely enraged. He crossed the room in
//terrible strides and yanked open the closet door.

// 3110
//The closet was empty.

// 3111
//One hour earlier, Harry listened from inside the closed closet. There was no
//sound from outside, and no point in taking risks either.

// 3112
//C-L-O-A-K, his fingers spelled out.

// 3113
//Once he was invisible, he very carefully and slowly cracked open the closet
//door and peeked out. No one seemed to be in the classroom.

// 3114
//The door wasn’t locked.

// 3115
//It was when Harry was outside the dangerous place and inside the hallway,
//safely invisible, that some of the anger drained away and he realized what he’d
//just done.

// 3116
//What he’d just done.

// 3117
//Harry’s invisible face was frozen in absolute horror.

// 3118
//He’d antagonized a teacher three orders of magnitude beyond anything he’d ever
//managed before. He’d threatened to walk out of Hogwarts and might have to
//follow through on it. He’d lost all the points Ravenclaw had and then he’d used
//the Time-Turner…

// 3119
//His imagination showed him his parents yelling at him after he was expelled,
//Professor McGonagall disappointed in him, and it was just too painful and he
//couldn’t bear it and he __couldn’t think of any way to save himself -__

// 3120
//The thought that Harry allowed himself to think was that if getting angry had
//gotten him into all this trouble, then maybe when he was angry he’d think of a
//way out, things seemed clearer somehow when he was angry.

// 3121
//And the thought that Harry didn’t let himself think was that he just couldn’t
//face this future if he wasn’t angry.

// 3122
//So he cast his thoughts back and remembered the burning humiliation -

// 3123
//__Tut, tut. Fame clearly isn’t everything.__

// 3124
//__Ten points from Ravenclaw for backchat.__

// 3125
//The calming cold washed back through his veins like a wave reflected and
//returning from some breaker, and Harry let out his breath.

// 3126
//Okay. Back to being sane now.

// 3127
//He was actually feeling a bit disappointed in his non-angry self for collapsing
//like that and wanting only to get out of trouble. Professor Severus Snape was
//__everyone’s__ problem. Normal-Harry had forgotten that and wished for a
//way to protect __himself.__ And let all the other victims go hang? The
//question wasn’t how to protect himself, the question was how to destroy this
//Potions professor.

// 3128
//__So this is my dark side, is it?__ __Bit of a prejudiced term that,
//my light side seems more selfish and cowardly, not to mention confused and
//panicky.__

// 3129
//And now that he was thinking clearly, it was equally clear what to do next.
//He’d already given himself an extra hour to prepare, and could get up to five
//hours more if required…

// 3130
//Minerva McGonagall waited in the Headmaster’s office.

// 3131
//Dumbledore sat in his padded throne behind his desk, dressed in four layers of
//formal lavender robes. Minerva sat in a chair before him, opposite Severus in
//another chair. Facing the three of them was an empty wooden stool.

// 3132
//They were waiting for Harry Potter.

// 3133
//__Harry,__ Minerva thought despairingly, __you promised you wouldn’t
//bite any teachers!__

// 3134
//And in her mind she could see very clearly the reply, Harry’s angry face and
//his outraged response: __I said I wouldn’t bite anyone who didn’t bite me
//first!__

// 3135
//There was a knock at the door.

// 3136
//“Come in!” Dumbledore called.

// 3137
//The door swept open, and Harry Potter entered. Minerva almost gasped out loud.
//The boy looked cool, collected, and utterly in control of himself.

// 3138
//“Good mor-” Harry’s voice suddenly cut off. His jaw dropped.

// 3139
//Minerva tracked Harry’s gaze, and she saw that Harry was staring at Fawkes
//where the phoenix sat on its golden perch. Fawkes fluttered his bright
//red-golden wings like the flickering of a flame, and dipped his head in a
//measured nod to the boy.

// 3140
//Harry turned to stare at Dumbledore.

// 3141
//Dumbledore winked at him.

// 3142
//Minerva felt she was missing something.

// 3143
//Sudden uncertainty crossed Harry’s face. His coolness wavered. Fear showed in
//his eyes, then anger, and then the boy was calm again.

// 3144
//A chill went down Minerva’s spine. Something was not right here.

// 3145
//“Please sit down,” said Dumbledore. His face was now serious once more.

// 3146
//Harry sat.

// 3147
//“So, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “I’ve heard one report of this day from Professor
//Snape. Would you care to tell me what happened in your own words?”

// 3148
//Harry’s gaze flicked dismissively to Severus. “It’s not complicated,” said the
//boy, smiling thinly. “He tried bullying me the way he’s been bullying every
//non-Slytherin in the school since the day Lucius foisted him off on you. As for
//the other details, I request a private conversation with you concerning them. A
//student who is reporting abusive behavior from a professor can hardly be
//expected to speak frankly in front of that same professor, after all.”

// 3149
//This time Minerva couldn’t stop herself from gasping out loud.

// 3150
//Severus simply laughed.

// 3151
//And the Headmaster’s face grew grave. “Mr. Potter,” the Headmaster said, “one
//does not speak of a Hogwarts professor in such terms. I fear that you labor
//under a terrible misapprehension. Professor Severus Snape has my fullest
//confidence, and serves Hogwarts at my own behest, not Lucius Malfoy’s.”

// 3152
//There was silence for a few moments.

// 3153
//When the boy spoke again his voice was icy. “Am I missing something here?”

// 3154
//“Quite a number of things, Mr. Potter,” said the Headmaster. “You should
//understand, to start with, that the purpose of this meeting is to discuss how
//to discipline you for the events of this morning.”

// 3155
//“This man has terrorized your school for years. I spoke to students and
//collected stories to make sure there would be enough for a newspaper campaign
//to rally the parents against him. Some of the younger students cried while they
//told me. I almost cried when I heard them! __You allowed this abuser to
//run free? You did this to your students? Why?__”

// 3156
//Minerva swallowed a lump in her throat. She’d - thought that, sometimes, but
//somehow she’d never quite -

// 3157
//“Mr. Potter,” said the Headmaster, his voice now stern, “this meeting is not
//about Professor Snape. It is about you and your disregard for school
//discipline. Professor Snape has suggested, and I have agreed, that three full
//months of detention will be appropriate -”

// 3158
//“Declined,” Harry said icily.

// 3159
//Minerva was speechless.

// 3160
//“This is not a request, Mr. Potter,” the Headmaster said. The full, entire
//force of the wizard’s gaze was turned on the boy. “This is your punishme-”

// 3161
//“You will explain to me why you allowed this man to hurt the children placed in
//your care, and if your explanation is not sufficient then I will begin my
//newspaper campaign with __you__ as the target.”

// 3162
//Minerva’s body swayed with the force of that blow, with the sheer raw
//__lese majeste__.

// 3163
//Even Severus looked shocked.

// 3164
//“That, Harry, would be most extremely unwise,” Dumbledore said slowly. “I am
//the primary piece opposing Lucius on the gameboard. For you to do such a thing
//would strengthen him greatly, and I did not think that was your chosen side.”

// 3165
//The boy was still for a long moment.

// 3166
//“This conversation grows private,” Harry said. His hand flicked in Severus’s
//direction. “Send him away.”

// 3167
//Dumbledore shook his head. “Harry, did I not tell you that Severus Snape has my
//fullest confidence?”

// 3168
//The boy’s face showed the shock of it. “This man’s bullying makes you
//vulnerable! I am not the only one who could start a newspaper campaign against
//you! This is insane! Why are you doing this?”

// 3169
//Dumbledore sighed. “I’m sorry, Harry. It has to do with things that you are
//not, at this time, ready to hear.”

// 3170
//The boy stared at Dumbledore. Then he turned to look at Severus. Then back to
//Dumbledore again.

// 3171
//“It __is__ insanity,” the boy said slowly. “You haven’t reined him in
//because you think he’s __part of the pattern__. That Hogwarts needs an
//evil Potions Master to be a proper magical school, just as it needs a ghost to
//teach History.”

// 3172
//“That does sound like the sort of thing I would do, doesn’t it?” said
//Dumbledore, smiling.

// 3173
//“Unacceptable,” Harry said flatly. His gaze was now cold and dark. “I will not
//tolerate bullying or abuse. I had considered many possible ways of dealing with
//this problem, but I will make it simple. Either this man goes, or I do.”

// 3174
//Minerva gasped again. Something strange flickered in Severus’s eyes.

// 3175
//Now Dumbledore’s gaze was also growing cold. “Expulsion, Mr. Potter, is the
//final threat which may be used against a student. It is not customarily used as
//a threat by students against the Headmaster. This is the best magical school in
//the entire world, and an education here is not an opportunity given to
//everyone. Are you under the impression that Hogwarts cannot get along without
//you?”

// 3176
//And Harry sat there, smiling thinly.

// 3177
//Sudden horror dawned on Minerva. Surely Harry wouldn’t -

// 3178
//“You forget,” Harry said, “that you’re not the only one who can see patterns.
//__This grows private. Now send him __-” Harry flicked a hand at Severus
//again, and then stopped in mid-sentence and mid-gesture.

// 3179
//Minerva could see it on Harry’s face, the moment when he remembered.

// 3180
//She’d told him, after all.

// 3181
//“Mr. Potter,” said the Headmaster, “once again, Severus Snape has my fullest
//confidence.”

// 3182
//“You told him,” whispered the boy. “You utter fool.”

// 3183
//Dumbledore didn’t react to the insult. “Told him what?”

// 3184
//“That the Dark Lord is alive.”

// 3185
//“__What in Merlin’s name are you on about, Potter?__” cried Severus in
//tones of sheer astonishment and outrage.

// 3186
//Harry glanced briefly at him, smiling grimly. “Oh, so we __are__ a
//Slytherin, then,” Harry said. “I was starting to wonder.”

// 3187
//And then there was silence.

// 3188
//Finally Dumbledore spoke. His voice was mild. “Harry, what __are__ you
//talking about?”

// 3189
//“I’m sorry, Albus,” Minerva whispered.

// 3190
//Severus and Dumbledore turned to look at her.

// 3191
//“Professor McGonagall didn’t tell me,” said Harry’s voice, swiftly and less
//calm than it had been. “I guessed. I told you, I can see the patterns too. I
//guessed, and she controlled her reaction just as Severus did. But her control
//fell a shade short of perfection, and I could tell it was control, not
//genuine.”

// 3192
//“And I told him,” said Minerva, her voice trembling a little, “that you, and I,
//and Severus were the only ones who knew.”

// 3193
//“Which she did as a concession to prevent me from simply going around asking
//questions, as I threatened to do if she didn’t talk,” Harry said. The boy
//chuckled briefly. “I really should have gotten one of you alone and told you
//that she told me everything, to see if you let anything slip. Probably wouldn’t
//have worked, but would have been worth a shot.” The boy smiled again. “Threat’s
//still on the table and I do expect to be briefed __fully__ at some point.”

// 3194
//Severus was giving her a look of utter contempt. Minerva raised her chin and
//bore it. She knew it was deserved.

// 3195
//Dumbledore leaned back in his padded throne. His eyes were as cold as anything
//Minerva had seen from him since the day his brother died. “And you threaten to
//abandon us to Voldemort if we do not comply with your wishes.”

// 3196
//Harry’s voice was razor-sharp. “I regret to inform you that you are not the
//center of the universe. I’m not threatening to walk out on magical Britain. I’m
//threatening to walk out on __you__. I am not a meek little Frodo. This is
//__my__ quest and if you want in you will play by __my__ rules.”

// 3197
//Dumbledore’s face was still cold. “I am beginning to doubt your suitability as
//the hero, Mr. Potter.”

// 3198
//Harry’s return gaze was equally icy. “I am beginning to doubt your suitability
//as my Gandalf, __Mr. Dumbledore__. Boromir was at least a plausible
//mistake. What is this __Nazgul__ doing in my Fellowship?”

// 3199
//Minerva was completely lost. She looked at Severus, to see if he was following
//this, and she saw that Severus had turned his face away from Harry’s field of
//vision and was smiling.

// 3200
//“I suppose,” Dumbledore said slowly, “that from your perspective it is a
//reasonable question. So, Mr. Potter, if Professor Snape is to leave you alone
//henceforth, will that be the last time this issue arises, or will I find you
//here every week with a new demand?”

// 3201
//“Leave __me__ alone?” Harry’s voice was outraged. “I am not his only
//victim and certainly not the most vulnerable! __Have you forgotten how
//defenseless children are? How much they hurt?__ Henceforth Severus will treat
//__every__ student of Hogwarts with appropriate and professional courtesy,
//or you will find another Potions Master, or you will find another hero!”

// 3202
//Dumbledore started laughing. Full-throated, warm, humorous laughter, as if
//Harry had just performed a comic dance in front of him.

// 3203
//Minerva didn’t dare move. Her eyes flickered and she saw that Severus was
//equally motionless.

// 3204
//Harry’s visage grew even colder. “You mistake me, Headmaster, if you think that
//this is a joke. This is not a request. This is your punishment.”

// 3205
//“Mr. Potter -” Minerva said. She didn’t even know what she was going to say.
//She simply couldn’t let that go by.

// 3206
//Harry made a shushing gesture at her and continued to speak to Dumbledore. “And
//if that seems impolite to you,” Harry said, his voice now a little less hard,
//“it seemed no less impolite when you said it to me. You would not say such a
//thing to anyone who you considered a real human being instead of a subordinate
//child, and I will treat you with just the same courtesy as you treat me -”

// 3207
//“Oh, indeed, in very deed, this is my punishment if ever there was one! Of
//__course__ you’re in here blackmailing me to save your fellow students,
//not to save yourself! I can’t imagine why I would have thought otherwise!”
//Dumbledore was now laughing even harder. He pounded his fist on the desk three
//times.

// 3208
//Harry’s gaze grew uncertain. His face turned toward her, addressing her for the
//first time. “Excuse me,” Harry said. His voice seemed to be wavering. “Does he
//need to take his medication or something?”

// 3209
//“Ah…” Minerva had no idea what she could possibly say.

// 3210
//“Well,” said Dumbledore. He wiped away tears that had formed in his eyes.
//“Pardon me. I’m sorry for the interruption. Please continue with the
//blackmail.”

// 3211
//Harry opened his mouth, then closed it again. He now seemed a little unsteady.
//“Ah… he’s also to stop reading students’ minds.”

// 3212
//“Minerva,” Severus said, his voice deadly, “you -”

// 3213
//“Sorting Hat warned me,” said Harry.

// 3214
//“__What?__”

// 3215
//“Can’t say anything else. Anyway I think that’s it. I’m done.”

// 3216
//Silence.

// 3217
//“Now what?” Minerva said, when it became apparent that no one else was going to
//say anything.

// 3218
//“Now what?” Dumbledore echoed. “Why, now the hero wins, of course.”

// 3219
//“__What?__” said Severus, Minerva, and Harry.

// 3220
//“Well, he certainly seems to have backed us into a corner,” Dumbledore said,
//smiling happily. “But Hogwarts __does__ need an evil Potions Master, or it
//just wouldn’t be a proper magical school, now would it? So how about if
//Professor Snape is only awful toward students in their fifth year and higher?”

// 3221
//“__What?__” said all three of them again.

// 3222
//“If it’s the most vulnerable victims about whom you’re concerned. Maybe you’re
//right, Harry. Maybe I __have__ forgotten over the decades what it’s like
//to be a child. So let’s compromise. Severus will continue to unfairly award
//points to Slytherin and impose lax discipline on his House, and he will be
//awful to non-Slytherin students in their fifth year and higher. To others he
//will be scary, but not abusive. He will promise to only read minds when the
//safety of a student requires it. Hogwarts will have its evil Potions Master,
//and the most vulnerable victims, as you put it, will be safe.”

// 3223
//Minerva McGonagall was as shocked as she’d ever been in her life. She glanced
//uncertainly at Severus, whose face had been left completely neutral, as though
//he couldn’t decide what sort of expression he ought to be wearing.

// 3224
//“I suppose that is acceptable,” Harry said. His voice sounded a bit odd.

// 3225
//“You can’t be serious,” Severus said, his voice as expressionless as his face.

// 3226
//“I am very much in favor of this,” Minerva said slowly. She was so much in
//favor that her heart was pounding wildly beneath her robes. “But what could we
//possibly tell the students? They might not have questioned this while Severus
//was… being awful to everyone, but -”

// 3227
//“Harry can tell the other students that he discovered a terrible secret of
//Severus’s and did a bit of blackmail,” said Dumbledore. “It’s true, after all;
//he discovered that Severus was reading minds, and he certainly did blackmail
//us.”

// 3228
//“This is insanity!” exploded Severus.

// 3229
//“Bwah ha ha!” said Dumbledore.

// 3230
//“Ah…” said Harry uncertainly. “And if anyone asks me why fifth years and above
//got shafted? I wouldn’t blame them for being irate, and that part wasn’t
//exactly my idea -”

// 3231
//“Tell them,” said Dumbledore, “that it wasn’t you who suggested the compromise,
//that it was all you could get. And then refuse to say anything more. That, too,
//is true. There’s an art to it, you’ll pick it up with practice.”

// 3232
//Harry nodded slowly. “And the points he took from Ravenclaw?”

// 3233
//“They must not be given back.”

// 3234
//It was Minerva who said it.

// 3235
//Harry looked at her.

// 3236
//“I’m sorry, Mr. Potter,” she said. She __was__ sorry, but it had to be
//done. “There __must__ be some consequences for your misbehavior or this
//school will fall to pieces.”

// 3237
//Harry shrugged. “Acceptable,” he said flatly. “But in the future Severus will
//not strike at my House connections by taking points from me, nor will he waste
//my valuable time with detentions. Should he feel that my behavior requires
//correction, he may communicate his concerns to Professor McGonagall.”

// 3238
//“Harry,” Minerva said, “will you continue to submit to school discipline, or
//are you to be above the law now, as Severus was?”

// 3239
//Harry looked at her. Something warm touched his gaze, briefly before it was
//quashed. “I will continue to be an ordinary student to every member of the
//staff who is not insane or evil, provided that they do not come under pressure
//from others who are.” Harry glanced briefly at Severus, then turned back to
//Dumbledore. “Leave Minerva alone, and I’ll be a regular Hogwarts student in her
//presence. No special privileges or immunities.”

// 3240
//“Beautiful,” Dumbledore said sincerely. “Spoken like a true hero.”

// 3241
//“And,” she said, “Mr. Potter must publicly apologize for his actions of today.”

// 3242
//Harry gave her another look. This one was a bit skeptical.

// 3243
//“The discipline of the school has been gravely injured by your actions, Mr.
//Potter,” Minerva said. “It must be restored.”

// 3244
//“I think, Professor McGonagall, that you considerably overestimate the
//importance of what you call school discipline, as compared to having History
//taught by a live teacher or not torturing your students. Maintaining the
//current status hierarchy and enforcing its rules seems ever so much more wise
//and moral and important when you are on the top and doing the enforcing than
//when you are on the bottom, and I can cite studies to this effect if required.
//I could go on for several hours about this point, but I will leave it at that.”

// 3245
//Minerva shook her head. “Mr. Potter, you underestimate the importance of
//discipline because you are not in need of it yourself -” She paused. That
//hadn’t come out right, and Severus, Dumbledore, and even Harry were giving her
//strange looks. “To learn, I mean. Not every child can learn in the absence of
//authority. And it is the other children who will be hurt, Mr. Potter, if they
//see your example as one to be followed.”

// 3246
//Harry’s lips curved into a twisted smile. “The first and last resort is the
//truth. The truth is that I shouldn’t have gotten angry, I shouldn’t have
//disrupted the class, I shouldn’t have done what I did, and I set a bad example
//for everyone. The truth is also that Severus Snape behaved in a fashion
//unbecoming a Hogwarts professor, and that from now on he will be more mindful
//of the injured feelings of students in their fourth year and under. The two of
//us could both get up and speak the truth. I could live with that.”

// 3247
//“In your dreams, Potter!” spat Severus.

// 3248
//“After all,” said Harry, smiling grimly, “if the students see that rules are
//for __everyone…__ for professors too, not just for poor helpless students
//who get nothing but suffering out of the system… why, the positive effects on
//school discipline should be __tremendous.__”

// 3249
//There was a brief pause, and then Dumbledore chuckled. “Minerva is thinking
//that you’re righter than you have any right to be.”

// 3250
//Harry’s gaze jerked away from Dumbledore, down to the floor. “Are __you__
//reading __her__ mind?”

// 3251
//“Common sense is often mistaken for Legilimency,” said Dumbledore. “I shall
//talk over this matter with Severus, and no apology will be required from you
//unless he apologizes as well. And now I declare this matter concluded, at least
//until lunchtime.” He paused. “Although, Harry, I’m afraid that Minerva wished
//to speak with you about an additional matter. And that is not the result of any
//pressure on my part. Minerva, if you would?”

// 3252
//Minerva rose from her chair and almost fell. There was too much adrenaline in
//her blood, her heart was beating too fast.

// 3253
//“Fawkes,” said Dumbledore, “accompany her, please.”

// 3254
//“I don’t -” she started to say.

// 3255
//Dumbledore shot her a look, and she fell silent.

// 3256
//The phoenix soared across the room like a smooth tongue of flame leaping out,
//and landed on her shoulder. She felt the warmth through her robes, all through
//her body.

// 3257
//“Please follow me, Mr. Potter,” she said, firmly now, and they left through the
//door.

// 3258
//They stood on the rotating stairs, descending in silence.

// 3259
//Minerva didn’t know what to say. She didn’t know this person who stood beside
//her.

// 3260
//And Fawkes began to croon.

// 3261
//It was tender, and soft, like a fireplace would sound if it had melody, and it
//washed over Minerva’s mind, easing, soothing, gentling what it touched…

// 3262
//“__What__ is __that?__” Harry whispered beside her. His voice was
//unstable, wobbling, changing pitch.

// 3263
//“The song of the phoenix,” said Minerva, not really aware of what she was
//saying, her attention was all on that strange quiet music. “It, too, heals.”

// 3264
//Harry turned his face from her, but she caught a glimpse of something agonized.

// 3265
//The descent seemed to take a very long time, or maybe it was only that the
//music seemed to take a very long time, and when they stepped out through the
//gap where a gargoyle had been, she was holding Harry’s hand firmly in hers.

// 3266
//As the gargoyle stepped back into place, Fawkes left her shoulder, and swooped
//to hover in front of Harry.

// 3267
//Harry stared at Fawkes like someone hypnotized by the ever-changing light of a
//fire.

// 3268
//“What am I to do, Fawkes?” whispered Harry. “I couldn’t have protected them if
//I hadn’t been angry.”

// 3269
//The phoenix’s wings continued flapping, it continued hovering in place. There
//was no sound but the beating of the wings. Then there was a flash like a fire
//flaring up and going out, and Fawkes was gone.

// 3270
//Both of them blinked, like waking up from a dream, or maybe like falling asleep
//again.

// 3271
//Minerva looked down.

// 3272
//Harry Potter’s bright young face looked up at her.

// 3273
//“Are phoenixes people?” said Harry. “I mean, are they smart enough to count as
//people? Could I talk with Fawkes if I knew how?”

// 3274
//Minerva blinked hard. Then she blinked again. “No,” Minerva said, her voice
//wavering. “Phoenixes are creatures of powerful magic. That magic gives their
//existence a weight of meaning which no simple animal could possess. They are
//fire, light, healing, rebirth. But in the end, no.”

// 3275
//“Where can I get one?”

// 3276
//Minerva leaned down and hugged him. She hadn’t meant to, but she didn’t seem to
//have much choice in the matter.

// 3277
//When she stood up she found it hard to speak. But she had to ask. “What
//happened today, Harry?”

// 3278
//“I don’t know the answers to any of the important questions either. Aside from
//that I’d really rather not think about it for a while.”

// 3279
//Minerva took his hand in hers again, and they walked the rest of the way in
//silence.

// 3280
//It was only a short trip, since naturally the office of the Deputy was close to
//the office of the Headmaster.

// 3281
//Minerva sat behind her desk.

// 3282
//Harry sat in front of her desk.

// 3283
//“So,” Minerva whispered. She would have given almost anything not to do this,
//or not to be the one who had to do it, or for it to be any time but right now.
//“There is a matter of school discipline. From which you are not exempt.”

// 3284
//“Namely?” said Harry.

// 3285
//He didn’t know. He hadn’t figured it out yet. She felt her throat tighten. But
//there was work to be done and she would not shirk it.

// 3286
//“Mr. Potter,” said Professor McGonagall, “I need to see your Time-Turner,
//please.”

// 3287
//All the peace of the phoenix vanished from his face in an instant and Minerva
//felt like she had just stabbed him.

// 3288
//“__No!__” Harry said. His voice was panicked. “I need it, I won’t be able
//to attend Hogwarts, I won’t be able to sleep!”

// 3289
//“You’ll be able to sleep,” she said. “The Ministry has delivered the protective
//shell for your Time-Turner. I will enchant it to open only between the hours of
//9PM and midnight.”

// 3290
//Harry’s face twisted. “But - but I -”

// 3291
//“Mr. Potter, how many times have you used the Time-Turner since Monday? How
//many hours?”

// 3292
//“I…” Harry said. “Hold on, let me add it up -” He glanced down at his watch.

// 3293
//Minerva felt a rush of sadness. She’d thought so. “It wasn’t just two per day,
//then. I suspect that if I asked your dormmates, I would find that you were
//struggling to stay up long enough to go to sleep at a reasonable time, and
//waking up earlier and earlier every morning. Correct?”

// 3294
//Harry’s face said everything she needed to know.

// 3295
//“Mr. Potter,” she said gently, “there are students who cannot be entrusted with
//Time-Turners, because they become addicted to them. We give them a potion which
//lengthens their sleep cycle by the necessary amount, but they end up using the
//Time-Turner for more than just attending their classes. And so we must take
//them back. Mr. Potter, you have taken to using the Time-Turner as your solution
//to everything, often very foolishly so. You used it to get back a Remembrall.
//You vanished from a closet in a fashion apparent to other students, instead of
//going back after you were out and getting me or someone else to come and open
//the door.”

// 3296
//From the look on Harry’s face he hadn’t thought of that.

// 3297
//“And more importantly,” she said, “you should have simply sat in Professor
//Snape’s class. And watched. And left at the end of class. As you would have
//done if you had not possessed a Time-Turner. There are some students who cannot
//be entrusted with Time-Turners, Mr. Potter. You are one of them. I am sorry.”

// 3298
//“But I __need__ it!” Harry blurted. “What if there are Slytherins
//threatening me and I have to escape? It keeps me __safe __-”

// 3299
//“Every other student in this castle runs the same risk, and I assure you that
//they survive. No student has died in this castle for fifty years. Mr. Potter,
//you will hand over your Time-Turner and do so now.”

// 3300
//Harry’s face twisted in agony, but he drew out the Time-Turner from under his
//robes and gave it to her.

// 3301
//From her desk, Minerva drew out one of the protective shells that had been sent
//to Hogwarts. She snapped the cover into place around the Time-Turner’s turning
//hourglass, and then she laid her wand on the cover to complete the enchantment.

// 3302
//“__This isn’t fair!__” Harry shrieked. “I saved half of Hogwarts from
//Professor Snape today, is it right that I be punished for it? I saw the look on
//your face, you __hated__ what he was doing!”

// 3303
//Minerva didn’t speak for a few moments. She was enchanting.

// 3304
//When she finished and looked up, she knew that her face was stern. Maybe it was
//the wrong thing to do. And then again maybe it was the right thing to do. There
//was an obstinate child in front of her, and that __didn’t__ mean the
//universe was broken.

// 3305
//“__Fair,__ Mr. Potter?” she snapped. “I have had to file __two
//reports__ with the Ministry on public use of a Time-Turner in __two
//successive days!__ Be __extremely__ grateful you were allowed to retain the
//Time-Turner even in restricted form! The Headmaster made a Floo call to plead
//with them personally and if you were not the Boy-Who-Lived even that would not
//have sufficed!”

// 3306
//Harry gaped at her.

// 3307
//She knew that he was seeing the angry face of Professor McGonagall.

// 3308
//Harry’s eyes filled up with tears.

// 3309
//“I’m, sorry,” he whispered, voice now choked and broken. “I’m sorry, to have,
//disappointed you…”

// 3310
//“I’m sorry too, Mr. Potter,” she said sternly, and handed him the newly
//restricted Time-Turner. “You may go.”

// 3311
//Harry turned and fled from her office, sobbing. She heard his feet pattering
//away down the hall, and then the sound cut off as the door swung closed.

// 3312
//“I’m sorry too, Harry,” she whispered to the quiet room. “I’m sorry too.”

// 3313
//Fifteen minutes into lunch hour.

// 3314
//No one was speaking to Harry. Some of the Ravenclaws were shooting him looks of
//anger, others of sympathy, a few of the youngest students even had looks of
//admiration, but no one was talking to him. Even Hermione hadn’t tried to come
//over.

// 3315
//Fred and George had gingerly stepped near. They hadn’t said anything. The offer
//was clear, and its optionality. Harry had told them that he would come over
//when dessert started, no earlier. They had nodded and quickly walked away.

// 3316
//It was probably the utterly expressionless look on Harry’s face that was doing
//it.

// 3317
//The others probably thought he was controlling anger, or dismay. They knew,
//because they’d seen Flitwick come and get him, that he’d been called to the
//Headmaster’s office.

// 3318
//Harry was trying not to smile, because if he smiled, he would start laughing,
//and if he started laughing, he wouldn’t stop until the nice people in white
//jackets came to haul him away.

// 3319
//It was too much. It was just all too much. Harry had almost gone over to the
//Dark Side, his dark side had done things that seemed in retrospect insane, his
//dark side had won an impossible victory that might have been real and might
//have been a pure whim of a crazy Headmaster, his dark side had protected his
//friends. He just couldn’t handle it any more. He needed Fawkes to sing to him
//again. He needed to use the Time-Turner to go off and take a quiet hour to
//recover but that wasn’t an option any more and the loss was like a hole in his
//existence but he couldn’t think about that because then he might start
//laughing.

// 3320
//Twenty minutes. All the students who were going to eat lunch had arrived,
//almost none had departed.

// 3321
//The tapping of a spoon rang through the Great Hall.

// 3322
//“If I may have your attention please,” Dumbledore said. “Harry Potter has
//something he would like to share with us.”

// 3323
//Harry took a deep breath and got up. He walked over to the Head Table, with
//every eye staring at him.

// 3324
//Harry turned and looked out at the four tables.

// 3325
//It was becoming harder and harder not to smile, but Harry kept his face
//expressionless as he spoke his brief and memorized speech.

// 3326
//“The truth is sacred,” Harry said tonelessly. “One of my most treasured
//possessions is a button which reads ‘Speak the truth, even if your voice
//trembles’. This, then, is the truth. Remember that. I am not saying it because
//I am being forced to say it, I am saying it because it is true. What I did in
//Professor Snape’s class was foolish, stupid, childish, and an inexcusable
//violation of the rules of Hogwarts. I disrupted the classroom and deprived my
//fellow students of their irreplaceable learning time. All because I failed to
//control my temper. I hope that not a single one of you will ever follow my
//example. I certainly intend to try never to follow it again.”

// 3327
//Many of the students gazing at Harry now had solemn, unhappy looks upon their
//faces, such as one might see at a ceremony marking the loss of a fallen
//champion. At the younger parts of the Gryffindor table the look was almost
//universal.

// 3328
//Until Harry raised his hand.

// 3329
//He did not raise it high. That might have appeared preemptory. He certainly did
//not raise it toward Severus. Harry simply raised his hand to chest level, and
//softly snapped his fingers, a gesture that was seen more than heard. It was
//possible that most of the Head Table wouldn’t see it at all.

// 3330
//This seeming gesture of defiance won sudden smiles from the younger students
//and Gryffindors, and coldly superior sneers from Slytherin, and frowns and
//worried looks from all others.

// 3331
//Harry kept his face expressionless. “Thank you,” he said. “That’s all.”

// 3332
//“Thank you, Mr. Potter,” said the Headmaster. “And now Professor Snape has
//something to share with us as well.”

// 3333
//Severus smoothly stood up from his place at the Head Table. “It has been
//brought to my attention,” he said, “that my own actions played a part in
//provoking the admittedly inexcusable anger of Mr. Potter, and in the ensuing
//discussion I realized that I had forgotten how easily injured are the feelings
//of the young and immature -”

// 3334
//There was the sound of many people emitting muffled chokes at the same time.

// 3335
//Severus continued as if he had not heard. “The Potions classroom is a dangerous
//place, and I still feel that strict discipline is necessary, but henceforth I
//will be more aware of the… emotional fragility… of students in their fourth
//year and younger. My deduction of points from Ravenclaw still stands, but I
//will revoke Mr. Potter’s detention. Thank you.”

// 3336
//There was a single clap from the direction of Gryffindor and faster than
//lightning Severus’s wand was in his hand and “__Quietus!__” silenced the
//offender.

// 3337
//“I will still demand discipline and respect in __all__ my classes,”
//Severus said coldly, “and anyone who trifles with me will regret it.”

// 3338
//He sat down.

// 3339
//“Thank you too!” Headmaster Dumbledore said cheerfully. “Carry on!”

// 3340
//And Harry, still expressionless, began to walk back to his seat in Ravenclaw.

// 3341
//There was an explosion of conversation. Two words were clearly identifiable in
//the beginning. The first was an initial “What -” beginning many different
//sentences such as “What just happened -” and “What the hell -” The second was
//“__Scourgify!__” as students cleaned up the dropped food and spit-out
//drinks from themselves, the tablecloth, and each other.

// 3342
//Some students were weeping openly. So was Professor Sprout.

// 3343
//At the Gryffindor table, where a cake waited with fifty-one unlit candles, Fred
//whispered, “I think we may be out of our league here, George.”

// 3344
//And from that day onward, no matter what Hermione tried to tell anyone, it
//would be an accepted legend of Hogwarts that Harry Potter could make absolutely
//anything happen by snapping his fingers.
