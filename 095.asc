//== Roles, Pt 6

// 16816
//__The third meeting__

// 16817
//__(10:31am, April 17th 1992)__

// 16818
//Spring had begun, the late-morning air still crisp with the leavings of winter.
//Daffodils had bloomed amid the sprouting grass of the forest, the gentle yellow
//petals with their golden hearts dangling limply from their dead, grayed stems,
//wounded or killed by one of the sudden frosts that you often saw in April. In
//the Forbidden Forest there would be stranger lifeforms, centaurs and unicorns
//at the least, and Harry had heard allegations of werewolves. Though from what
//Harry had read of real-life werewolves, that did not make the slightest bit of
//sense.

// 16819
//Harry didn’t venture anywhere near the border of the Forbidden Forest, since
//there was no reason to take the risk. He walked invisibly among the more
//ordinary life-forms of the permitted woods, wand in hand, a broomstick strapped
//to his back for easier access, just in case. He was not actually afraid; Harry
//thought it odd that he didn’t feel afraid. The state of constant vigilance,
//readiness for fight or flight, failed to feel burdensome or even abnormal.

// 16820
//On the edges of the permitted woods Harry walked, his feet never straying near
//the beaten path where he might be more easily found, never leaving sight of
//Hogwarts’s windows. Harry had set the alarm upon his mechanical watch to tell
//him when it was lunchtime, since he couldn’t actually look at his wrist, being
//invisible and all that. It raised the question of how his eyeglasses worked
//while he was wearing the Cloak. For that matter the Law of the Excluded Middle
//seemed to imply that either the rhodopsin complexes in his retina were
//absorbing photons and transducing them to neural spikes, or alternatively,
//those photons were going straight through his body and out the other side, but
//not both. It really did seem increasingly likely that invisibility cloaks let
//you see outward while being invisible yourself because, on some fundamental
//level, that was how the caster had - not __wanted__ - but
//__implicitly believed__ - that invisibility should work.

// 16821
//Whereupon you had to wonder whether anyone had tried Confunding or Legilimizing
//someone into implicitly and matter-of-factly believing that __Fixus
//Everythingus__ ought to be an easy first-year Charm, and then trying to invent
//it.

// 16822
//Or maybe find a worthy Muggleborn in a country that didn’t identify Muggleborn
//children, and tell them some extensive lies, fake up a surrounding story and
//corresponding evidence, so that, from the very beginning, they’d have a
//different idea of what magic could do. Though apparently they’d still have to
//learn a number of previous Charms before they became capable of inventing their
//own…

// 16823
//It might not work. Surely there’d been some organically insane wizards who’d
//truly believed in their own possibility of godhood, and yet had failed to
//become god. But even the insane had probably believed the ascension spell ought
//to be some grandiose dramatic ritual and not something you did with a carefully
//composed twitch of your wand and the incantation __Becomus Goddus.__

// 16824
//Harry was already pretty sure it wouldn’t be that easy. But then the question
//was, __why not?__ What pattern had his brain learned? Could the reason be
//predicted in advance?

// 16825
//A slight fringe of apprehension crept through Harry then, a tinge of worry, as
//he contemplated this question. The nameless concern sharpened, grew greater -

// 16826
//__Professor Quirrell?__

// 16827
//“Mr. Potter,” a soft voice called from behind him.

// 16828
//Harry spun, his hand going to the Time-Turner beneath his cloak; again the
//principle of being ready to flee upon an instant’s notice felt only ordinary.

// 16829
//Slowly, palms empty and turned outward, Professor Quirrell was walking towards
//him within the forests’ outskirts, coming from the general direction of the
//Hogwarts castle.

// 16830
//“Mr. Potter,” Professor Quirrell said again. “I know that you’re here. You know
//that I know that you’re here. I must speak to you.”

// 16831
//Still Harry said nothing. Professor Quirrell hadn’t actually said what this was
//about, and Harry’s sunlit morning walk about the forest edge had produced a
//mood of silence within him.

// 16832
//Professor Quirrell took a small step to the left, a step forward, another to
//the right. He tilted his head with a look of calculation, and then he walked
//almost directly towards where Harry stood, halted a few paces off with the
//sense of doom enflamed to the height of bearability.

// 16833
//“Are you still resolved upon your course?” Professor Quirrell said. “The same
//course you spoke of yesterday?”

// 16834
//Again Harry did not reply.

// 16835
//Professor Quirrell sighed. “There is much I have done for you,” the man said.
//“Whatever else you may wonder of me, you cannot deny that. I am calling in some
//of the debt. Talk to me, Mr. Potter.”

// 16836
//__I don’t feel like doing this right now,__ Harry thought; then:
//__Oh, right.__

// 16837
//Two hours later, after Harry had spun the Time-Turner once, noted down the
//exact time and memorized his exact location, spent another hour walking, went
//inside and told Professor McGonagall that he was currently talking to the
//Defense Professor in the woods outside Hogwarts (just in case anything happened
//to him), walked for a further hour, then returned to his original location
//exactly one hour after he’d left and spun the Time-Turner again -

// 16838
//“What was that?” Professor Quirrell said, blinking. “Did you just -”

// 16839
//“Nothing important,” Harry said without pulling back the hood of his
//invisibility cloak, or taking his hand from his Time-Turner. “Yes, I’m still
//resolved. To be honest, I’m thinking I shouldn’t have said anything.”

// 16840
//Professor Quirrell inclined his head. “A sentiment which shall serve you well
//in life. Is there anything which is liable to change your mind?”

// 16841
//“Professor, if I already __knew__ about the existence of an argument which
//would change my decision -”

// 16842
//“True, for the likes of us. But you would be surprised how often someone knows
//what they are waiting to hear, yet must wait to hear it said.” Professor
//Quirrell shook his head. “To put this in your terms… there is a true fact,
//known to me but not to you, of which I would like to convince you, Mr. Potter.”

// 16843
//Harry’s eyebrows rose, though he realized in the next moment that Professor
//Quirrell couldn’t see it. “That’s in my terms, all right. Go ahead.”

// 16844
//“The intention you have formed is far more dangerous than you realize.”

// 16845
//Replying to this surprising statement did not take much thought on Harry’s
//part. “Define dangerous, and tell me what you think you know and how you think
//you know it.”

// 16846
//“Sometimes,” said Professor Quirrell, “telling someone about a danger can cause
//them to walk directly into it. I have no intention of having that happen this
//time. Do you expect me to tell you exactly what you must not do? Exactly why I
//am afraid?” The man shook his head. “If you were wizardborn, Mr. Potter, you
//would know to take it seriously, when a powerful magus tells you only to
//beware.”

// 16847
//It would have been a lie to say that Harry was not annoyed, but he also wasn’t
//an idiot; so Harry said merely, “Is there anything you __can__ tell me?”

// 16848
//Carefully, Professor Quirrell seated himself upon the grass, and took out his
//wand, his hand assuming a position that Harry recognized. Harry’s breath
//caught.

// 16849
//“This is the last time that I shall be able to do this for you,” Professor
//Quirrell said quietly. Then the man began to speak words that were strange, of
//no language Harry could recognize, intonation that seemed not quite human,
//words which seemed to slip from Harry’s memory even as he tried to grasp them,
//exiting from his mind as quickly as they entered.

// 16850
//The spell took effect more slowly, this time. The trees seemed to darken,
//branches and leaves staining, as though seen through perfect sunglasses that
//faded and attenuated light without distorting it. The blue bowl of the sky
//receded, the horizon which Harry’s brain falsely assigned a finite distance
//pulling back as it turned gray, and darker gray. The clouds became translucent,
//transparent, wisping away to let the darkness shine through.

// 16851
//The forest shaded, faded, abated into blackness.

// 16852
//The great sky river became visible once again, as Harry’s eyes adjusted, became
//able to see the largest object which human eyes could ever behold as more than
//a point, the surrounding Milky Way.

// 16853
//And the stars, piercingly bright and yet remote, out of a great depth.

// 16854
//Professor Quirrell breathed deeply. Then he raised his wand again (just barely
//visible, in the starlight without sun or moon) and tapped himself on the head
//with a sound like an egg cracking.

// 16855
//The Defense Professor also faded away, became likewise invisible.

// 16856
//A tiny disk of grass, illuminated by not much light at all, drifted unoccupied
//within empty space.

// 16857
//Neither of them spoke for a time. Harry was content to look at the stars,
//undistracted even by his own body. Whatever Professor Quirrell had called him
//here to say, it would be said in due time.

// 16858
//In due time, a voice spoke.

// 16859
//“There is no war here,” said a soft voice emanating from within the emptiness.
//“No conflict and battle, no politics and betrayal, no death and no life. That
//is all for the folly of men. The stars are above such foolishness, untouched by
//it. Here there is peace, and silence eternal. So I once thought.”

// 16860
//Harry turned to look at where the voice originated, and saw only stars.

// 16861
//“So you once thought?” Harry said, when no other words seemed to be
//forthcoming.

// 16862
//“There is nothing above the folly of men,” whispered the voice from the
//emptiness. “There is nothing beyond the destructive powers of sufficiently
//intelligent idiocy, not even the stars themselves. I went to a great deal of
//trouble to make a certain golden plaque last forever. I would not like to see
//it destroyed by human folly.”

// 16863
//Again Harry’s eyes reflexively darted toward where the voice should have been,
//again saw only emptiness. “I think I can reassure you on that score, Professor.
//Nuclear weapons don’t have a fireball extending out for… how far away is
//Pioneer 11? Somewhere around a billion kilometers, maybe? Muggles talk about
//nuclear weapons destroying the world, but what they actually mean is lightly
//warming up some of Earth’s surface. The __Sun__ is a giant fusion reaction
//and __it __doesn’t vaporize distant space probes. The worst-case scenario
//for nuclear war wouldn’t even come close to destroying the Solar System, not
//that this is much of a consolation.”

// 16864
//“True while we speak of Muggles,” said the soft voice amid starlight. “But what
//do Muggles know of true power? It is not they who frighten me now. It is you.”

// 16865
//“Professor,” Harry said carefully, “while I have to admit I’ve rolled a few
//critical failures in my life, there’s a bit of distance between that and
//missing a saving throw so hard that the Pioneer 11 probe gets caught in the
//blast radius. There’s no realistic way to do that without blowing up the Sun.
//And before you ask, our Sun is a main-sequence G-type star, it __can’t__
//explode. Any energy input would just increase the volume of the hydrogen
//plasma, the Sun doesn’t have a degenerate core that could be detonated. The Sun
//doesn’t have enough mass to go supernova, even at the end of its lifespan.”

// 16866
//“Such amazing things the Muggles have learned,” the other voice murmured. “How
//stars live, how they are preserved from death, how they die. And they never
//wonder if such knowledge might be dangerous.”

// 16867
//“In all frankness, Professor, that particular thought has never occurred to me
//either.”

// 16868
//“You are Muggleborn. I speak not of blood, I speak of how you spent your
//childhood years. There is a freedom of thought in that, true. But there is also
//wisdom in the caution of wizardkind. It has been three hundred and twenty-three
//years since the magical territories of Sicily were ruined by one man’s folly.
//Such incidents were more common in the years when Hogwarts was raised. Commoner
//still, in the aftertime of Merlin. Of the time before Merlin, little remains to
//study.”

// 16869
//“There’s around thirty orders of magnitude of difference between that and
//blowing up the Sun,” Harry observed, then caught himself. “But that’s a
//pointless quibble, sorry, blowing up a country would also be bad, I agree. In
//any case, Professor, I don’t plan on doing anything like that.”

// 16870
//“Your choice is not required, Mr. Potter. If you had read more wizardborn
//novels and fewer Muggle stories, you would know. In serious literature the
//wizard whose foolishness threatens to unleash the Shambling Bone-Men will not
//be deliberately bent on such a goal, that is for children’s books. This truly
//dangerous wizard shall perhaps be bent on some project of which he anticipates
//great renown, and the certain prospect of losing that renown and living out his
//life in obscurity will seem to him more vivid than the unknown prospect of
//destroying his country. Or he shall have promised success to one he cannot bear
//to disappoint. Perhaps he has children in debt. There is much literary wisdom
//in those stories. It is born of harsh experience and cities of ash. The most
//likely prospect for disaster is a powerful wizard who, for whatever reason,
//cannot bring himself to halt as warning signs appear. Though he may speak much
//and loudly of caution, he will not be able to bring himself actually to halt. I
//wonder, Mr. Potter, have you thought of trying anything which Hermione Granger
//herself would have told you not to do?”

// 16871
//“All __right, __point taken,” said Harry. “Professor, I am well aware that
//if I save Hermione at the price of two other people’s lives, I’ve lost on total
//points from a utilitarian standpoint. I am __extremely__ aware that
//Hermione would not want me to risk destroying a whole country just to save her.
//That’s just common sense.”

// 16872
//“Child who destroys Dementors,” said that soft voice, “if it were only one
//country I feared you might ruin, I would be less concerned. I did not at first
//credit that your knowledge of Muggle science and Muggle practices would be a
//source of great power. I now credit it more. I am, in complete sincerity,
//concerned for the safety of that golden plaque.”

// 16873
//“Well, if science fiction has taught me anything,” said Harry, “it’s taught me
//that destroying the Solar System is not morally acceptable, especially if you
//do it before humanity has colonized any other star systems.”

// 16874
//“Then will you give up this -”

// 16875
//“No,” Harry said without even thinking before he opened his mouth. After a
//moment, he added, “But I do understand what you’re trying to tell me.”

// 16876
//Silence. The stars had not shifted, not even as they would have in an Earthly
//night sky, over time.

// 16877
//A very slight rustle, as of someone shifting their body. Harry realized that he
//had been standing for a while in the same position, and dropped down to the
//almost unseeable circle of grass that still stayed beneath him, careful not to
//touch the edges of the spell.

// 16878
//“Tell me this,” said the soft voice. “Why does that girl matter to you so
//much?”

// 16879
//“Because she is my friend.”

// 16880
//“In the English language as it is customarily used, Mr. Potter, the word
//‘friend’ is not associated with a desperate effort to raise the dead. Are you
//under the impression that she is your true love, or some such?”

// 16881
//“Oh, not you too,” Harry said wearily. “Not you of all people, Professor. Fine,
//we’re best friends, but that’s __all,__ okay? That’s enough. Friends don’t
//let friends stay dead.”

// 16882
//“Ordinary folk do not do as much, for those they call friends.” The voice
//sounded more distant now, abstracted. “Not even for those they say they love.
//Their companions die, and they do not go in search of power to resurrect them.”

// 16883
//Harry couldn’t help himself. He looked over again, despite knowing it would be
//futile, and saw only more stars. “Let me guess, from this you deduce that…
//people don’t actually care as much about their friends as they pretend.”

// 16884
//A brief laugh. “They would scarcely pretend to care __less__.”

// 16885
//“They care, Professor, and not just for their true loves. Soldiers throw
//themselves on grenades to save their friends, mothers run into burning houses
//to save their children. But if you’re a Muggle you don’t think there’s any such
//thing as magic to bring someone back to life. And normal wizards don’t…
//__think outside the box__ like that. I mean, most wizards aren’t searching
//for power to make __themselves__ immortal. Does that prove they don’t care
//about their own lives?”

// 16886
//“As you say, Mr. Potter. Certainly I myself would consider their lives
//pointless and without a shred of value. Perhaps, somewhere in their hidden
//hearts, they also believe that my opinion of them is the correct one.”

// 16887
//Harry shook his head, and then, in annoyance, cast back the hood of his Cloak,
//and shook his head again. “That seems like a rather __contrived__ view of
//the world, Professor,” said the dim-lit head of a boy, floating unsupported on
//a circle of dark grass amid stars. “Trying to invent a resurrection spell just
//isn’t something normal people would think of, so you can’t deduce anything from
//their not taking the option.”

// 16888
//A moment later, the dim-lit outline of a man sitting on the circle of grass was
//visible as well.

// 16889
//“If they __truly__ cared about their supposed loved ones,” the Defense
//Professor said softly, “they would think of it, would they not?”

// 16890
//“Brains don’t work that way. They don’t suddenly supercharge when the stakes go
//up - or when they do, it’s within hard limits. I couldn’t calculate the
//thousandth digit of pi if someone’s life depended on it.”

// 16891
//The dim-lit head inclined. “But there is another possible explanation, Mr.
//Potter. It is that people play the __role__ of friendship. They do just as
//much as that role requires of them, and no more. The thought occurs to me that
//perhaps the difference between you and them is not that you care more than they
//do. Why would you have been born with such unusually strong emotions of
//friendship, that you alone among wizardkind are driven to resurrect Hermione
//Granger after her death? No, the most likely difference is not that you care
//more. It is that, being a more logical creature than they, you alone have
//thought that playing the role of Friend would require this of you.”

// 16892
//Harry stared out at the stars. He would have been lying if he’d claimed not to
//be shaken. “That… can’t be true, Professor. I could name a dozen examples in
//Muggle novels of people driven to resurrect their dead friends. The authors of
//those stories clearly understood exactly how I feel about Hermione. Though you
//wouldn’t have read them, I guess… maybe Orpheus and Eurydice? I didn’t actually
//read that one but I know what’s in it.”

// 16893
//“Such tales are also told among wizardkind. There is the story of the Elric
//brothers. The tale of Dora Kent, who was protected by her son Saul. There is
//Ronald Mallett and his doomed challenge to Time. In Sicily before its fall, the
//drama of Precia Testarossa. In Nippon they tell of Akemi Homura and her lost
//love. What these stories have in common, Mr. Potter, is that they are all
//__fiction.__ Real-life wizards do not attempt the same, even though the
//notion is clearly __not__ beyond their imagination.”

// 16894
//“Because they don’t think they __can!__” Harry’s voice rose.

// 16895
//“Shall we go and tell the good Professor McGonagall about your intention to
//find a way to resurrect Miss Granger, and see what she thinks of it? Perhaps it
//has simply never occurred to her to consider that option… Ah, but you hesitate.
//You already know her answer, Mr. Potter. Do you know why you know it?” You
//could hear the cold smile in the voice. “A lovely technique, that. Thank you
//for teaching it to me.”

// 16896
//Harry was aware of the tension that had developed in his face, his words came
//out as though bitten off. “Professor McGonagall has not grown up with the
//Muggle concept of the increasing power of science, and nobody’s ever told her
//that when a friend’s life is at stake is a time when you need to __think
//very rationally__ -”

// 16897
//The Defense Professor’s voice was also rising. “The Transfiguration Professor
//is __reading from a script,__ Mr. Potter! That script calls for her to
//mourn and grieve, that all may know how much she cared. Ordinary people react
//poorly if you suggest that they go off-script. As you already knew!”

// 16898
//“That’s funny, I could have sworn I saw Professor McGonagall going off-script
//at dinner yesterday. If I saw her go off-script another ten times I might
//actually try to talk to her about resurrecting Hermione, but right now she’s
//new to that and needs practice. In the end, Professor, what you’re trying to
//explain away by calling love and friendship and everything else a lie is just
//__human beings not knowing any better.__”

// 16899
//The Defense Professor’s voice rose in pitch. “If it were you who had been
//killed by that troll, it would not even __occur__ to Hermione Granger to
//do as you are doing for her! It would not occur to Draco Malfoy, nor to Neville
//Longbottom, nor to McGonagall or any of your precious friends! There is not one
//person in this world who would return to you the care that you are showing her!
//So __why?__ Why do it, Mr. Potter?” There was a strange, wild desperation
//in that voice. “Why be the only one in the world who goes to such lengths to
//keep up the pretense, when none of them will ever do the same for you?”

// 16900
//“I believe you are factually mistaken, Professor,” Harry returned evenly.
//“About a number of things, in fact. At the very least, your model of my
//emotions is flawed. Because you don’t understand me the tiniest bit, if you
//think that it would stop me if everything you said was __true.__
//Everything in the world has to start somewhere, every event that happens has to
//happen for a first time. Life on Earth had to start with some little
//self-replicating molecule in a pool of mud. And if I were the first person in
//the world, no -”

// 16901
//Harry’s hand swept out, to indicate the terribly distant points of light.

// 16902
//“- if I were the first person in the __universe__ who ever really cared
//about someone else, which I’m __not__ by the way, then I’d be honored to
//be that person, and I’d try to do it justice.”

// 16903
//There was a long silence.

// 16904
//“You truly do care about that girl,” the man’s dim outline said softly. “You
//care about her in the way that none of __them__ are capable of caring for
//their own lives, let alone each other.” The Defense Professor’s voice had
//become strange, filled with some indecipherable emotion. “I do not understand
//it, but I know the lengths you will go to because of it. You will challenge
//death itself, for her. Nothing will sway you from that.”

// 16905
//“I care enough to make an actual effort,” Harry said quietly. “Yes, that is
//correct.”

// 16906
//The starlight slowly began to fracture, the world shining through the cracks;
//slashes through the night showing treetrunks and leaves glowing in the
//sunlight. Harry raised a hand, blinking hard, as the returning brightness
//smashed into his dark-adjusted eyes; and his eyes automatically went to the
//Defense Professor, just in case an attack occurred while he was blinded.

// 16907
//When all the stars had gone and only daylight remained, Professor Quirrell was
//still sitting on the grass. “Well, Mr. Potter,” he said in his normal voice,
//“if that is so, then I shall give you what help I can, while I can.”

// 16908
//“You’ll __what?__” Harry said involuntarily.

// 16909
//“My offer as I made it yesterday still stands. Ask and I will answer. Show me
//the same science books you deemed suitable for Mr. Malfoy, and I shall look
//them over and tell you what comes to mind. Don’t look so surprised, Mr. Potter,
//I would hardly leave you to your own devices.”

// 16910
//Harry stared, tear ducts still watering from the sudden light.

// 16911
//Professor Quirrell looked back at him. Something strange glinted in the pale
//eyes. “I have done what I can, and now I fear I must take my leave of you. Good
//-” and the Defense Professor hesitated. “Good day, Mr. Potter.”

// 16912
//“Good -” Harry began.

// 16913
//The man sitting on the grass fell over, his head impacting the ground with a
//light thud. At the same time the sense of doom diminished so sharply that Harry
//leapt to his feet, his heart suddenly in his throat.

// 16914
//But the figure on the ground slowly pushed back up to a crawling position.
//Turned to look at Harry, eyes empty, mouth slack. Tried to stand, fell back to
//the ground.

// 16915
//Harry took a step forward, sheer instinct telling him to offer a hand, although
//that was incorrect; the apprehension that rose up in him, however faint, spoke
//of continued danger.

// 16916
//But the fallen figure flinched away from Harry, and then slowly began crawl to
//away from him, in the general direction of the distant castle.

// 16917
//The boy standing amid the forest gazed after.
