//== SA, Aftermaths: Surface Appearances

// 13464
//__Aftermath: Albus Dumbledore and -__

// 13465
//The old wizard sat alone at his desk, in the unsilence of the Headmaster’s
//office, amid the innumerable and unnoticed devices; his robes a gentle yellow,
//of soft fabric, not such clothing as he ordinarily wore before others. His
//wrinkled hand held a quill scratching away at an official-looking parchment. If
//you had somehow been there to watch his lined face, you would have been unable
//to deduce anything more about the man himself than you understood of the
//enigmatic devices. You might have observed that the face looked a little sad, a
//little tired, but then Albus Dumbledore always looked like that when he was
//alone.

// 13466
//In the Floo hearth there were only scattered ashes without a hint of flame, a
//magical door that had been shut so solidly as to stop existing. On the material
//plane, the great oaken door to the office had been closed and locked; beyond
//that door, the Endless Stairs stayed motionless; at the bottom of those stairs,
//the gargoyles that blocked the entrance did not flow, their pseudo-life
//withdrawn to leave solid rock.

// 13467
//Then, even as the quill was in the middle of penning a word, even as it was in
//the middle of scratching a letter -

// 13468
//The old wizard shot to his feet with a speed that would have shocked anyone
//watching, abandoning the quill in mid-letter to fall onto the parchment; like
//lightning he spun on the oaken door, his yellow robes whirling around him and a
//wand of dread power leaping into his hand -

// 13469
//And as abruptly, the old wizard paused, halting his motion even as the wand
//came to bear.

// 13470
//A hand struck upon the oaken door, three times knocking.

// 13471
//More slowly, now, that grim wand went back into the dueling holster strapped
//beneath the old wizard’s sleeve. The ancient man moved forward a few paces,
//drew himself up into a more formal stance, composed his face. Nearby upon the
//desk, the quill moved to the side of the parchment, as though it had been
//carefully placed there rather than dropped in haste; and the parchment itself
//flipped over to show blankness.

// 13472
//With a silent twitch of his will, the oaken door swung open.

// 13473
//Hard as stones, the green eyes glared at him.

// 13474
//“I admit that I am impressed, Harry,” the old wizard said quietly. “The Cloak
//of Invisibility would have let you evade my lesser means of vision; but I did
//not sense my golems step aside, nor the stairs turning. How did you come here?”

// 13475
//The boy walked into the office, step by deliberate step until the door closed
//smoothly behind him. “I can go anywhere I choose, with or without permission,”
//that boy said. His voice seemed calm; too calm, perhaps. “I am in your office
//because I decided to be here, and to hell with passwords. You are greatly
//mistaken, Headmaster Dumbledore, if you think that I stay in this school
//because I am a prisoner here. I simply have not chosen, __yet__, to leave.
//Now keeping that in mind, why did you command your agent, Professor Snape, to
//break the agreement we made in this office, that he would not torment any
//student in her fourth year or below?”

// 13476
//The old wizard looked at the angry young hero for a long moment. Then, slowly
//enough not to alarm the boy, those wizened fingers drew open one of the
//manifold drawers of the desk, lifted out a sheet of parchment, laid it upon the
//desk. “Fourteen,” the old wizard said. “It is not the number of all the owls
//sent last night. Only the owls sent to families with a seat on the Wizengamot,
//or families of great wealth, or families already allied with your foes. Or, in
//the case of Robert Jugson, all three; for his father, Lord Jugson, is a Death
//Eater, and his grandfather a Death Eater who died by Alastor Moody’s wand. What
//the letters said, I do not know, but I can guess. Do you __still__ not
//understand, Harry Potter? Each time Hermione Granger __won__, as you put
//it, the danger to her from Slytherin grew again, and yet again. But now the
//Slytherins have triumphed over her, easily and safely, without violence or
//lasting harm. They have won, and need fight no more…” The old wizard sighed.
//“So I had planned. So I had hoped. So it would have been, if the Defense
//Professor had not taken it upon himself to intervene. Now the dispute goes to
//the Board of Governors, where Severus will seem to conquer the Defense
//Professor; but that will not feel the same to the Slytherins, it will not have
//been over and finished in a moment, to their satisfaction.”

// 13477
//The boy advanced further into the room, his head tilting back further to look
//up at the half-moon glasses; and somehow it was like the boy was looking down
//at the Headmaster, rather than up. “So this Lord Jugson is a Death Eater?” the
//boy said softly. “Good. His life is already bought and paid for, then, and I
//can do anything I want to him without ethical problems -”

// 13478
//“__Harry!__”

// 13479
//The boy’s voice was clear as ice, frozen of purest water from some untouched
//spring. “You seem to think that the Light should live in fear of the darkness.
//I say it should be the other way around. I’d prefer not to kill this Lord
//Jugson, even if he is a Death Eater. But one hour of brainstorming with the
//Defense Professor would be plenty of time to come up with some creative way to
//wreck him financially, or get him exiled from magical Britain. That would serve
//to make the point, I think.”

// 13480
//“I confess,” the old wizard said slowly, “that the thought of ruining a
//five-hundred-year-old House, and challenging a Death Eater to war to the
//finish, over a scuffle in a Hogwarts hallway, had not occurred to me, Harry.”
//The old wizard lifted a finger to push back his half-moon glasses from where
//they had slid a little down his nose, during his sudden motion earlier. “I
//daresay it would not occur to Miss Granger either, nor to Professor McGonagall,
//nor to Fred and George.”

// 13481
//The boy shrugged. “It wouldn’t __be__ about the hallways,” the boy said.
//“It would be justice for his past crimes, and I’d only do it if Jugson made the
//first move. The point isn’t to make people scared of me as a wild card, after
//all. It’s to teach them that neutrals are perfectly safe from me, and poking me
//with a stick is incredibly dangerous.” The boy smiled in a way that didn’t
//reach his eyes. “Maybe I’ll buy an ad in the Daily Prophet, saying that anyone
//who wants to carry on this dispute with me will learn the true meaning of
//Chaos, but anyone who leaves me alone will be fine.”

// 13482
//“__No__,” the old wizard said. His voice was deeper now, showing something
//of his true age and power. “No, Harry, that must not be. You have not yet
//learned the meaning of fighting, what truly happens when foes meet in battle.
//And so you dream, as young boys do, of teaching your foes to fear you. It
//frightens me that you, at far too young an age, might already have enough power
//to make some part of your dreams into reality. There is __no__ turning of
//that road which does not lead into darkness, Harry, none. That is the way of a
//Dark Lord, for certain.”

// 13483
//The boy hesitated, then, and his eyes flickered to the empty golden platform
//where Fawkes sometimes rested his wings. It was a gesture that few would have
//caught, but the old wizard knew it very well.

// 13484
//“All right, forget the part about teaching them to fear me,” the boy said then.
//His voice was no less hard, but some of the cold had gone from it. “I still
//don’t think you should let children get hurt out of fear of what someone like
//Lord Jugson __might__ do. Protecting them is the whole point of your job.
//If Lord Jugson really does try to get in your way, then do whatever it takes to
//stop him. Give me full access to my vaults, and __I’ll__ take personal
//responsibility for dealing with any fallout from banning bullies in Hogwarts,
//whether it’s Lord Jugson or anyone else.”

// 13485
//Slowly the old wizard shook his head. “You seem to think, Harry, that I need
//merely use my full power, and all foes will be swept aside. You are wrong.
//Lucius Malfoy controls Minister Fudge, through the __Daily Prophet__ he
//sways all Britain, only by bare margins does he not control enough of the Board
//of Governors to oust me from Hogwarts. Amelia Bones and Bartemius Crouch are
//allies, but even they would step aside if they saw us acting wantonly. The
//world that surrounds you is more fragile than you seem to believe, and we must
//walk with greater care. The old Wizarding War never ended, Harry, it only
//continued in a different form; the black king slept, and Lucius Malfoy moved
//his chesspieces for a time. Do you think Lucius Malfoy would lightly permit you
//to take a pawn of his color?”

// 13486
//The boy smiled, now with a touch of coldness again. “Okay, I’ll figure out some
//way to set it up so that it looks like Lord Jugson betrayed his own side.”

// 13487
//“Harry -”

// 13488
//“Obstacles mean you __get creative__, Headmaster. It doesn’t mean you
//abandon the children you’re supposed to protect. Let the Light win, and if
//trouble comes of it -” The boy shrugged. “Let Light win again.”

// 13489
//“So might phoenixes speak, if they had words,” the old wizard said. “But you do
//not understand the __phoenix’s price.__”

// 13490
//The last two words were spoken in a peculiarly clear voice that seemed to echo
//around the office, and then a huge rumbling noise seemed to come from all
//around them.

// 13491
//Between the ancient shield on the wall and the Sorting Hat’s hatrack, the stone
//of the walls began to flow and move, pouring itself into two framing columns
//and revealing a gap between them, an opening that showed a set of stone stairs
//leading upward into darkness.

// 13492
//The old wizard turned and strode toward those stairs, and then looked back at
//where Harry Potter stood. “Come!” said the old wizard. There was no twinkle now
//in those blue eyes. “Since you have already gone so far as to force your way
//here uninvited, you may as well go further.”

// 13493
//There were no railings on those stone steps, and after the first few steps
//Harry drew his wand and cast __Lumos.__ The Headmaster did not look back,
//did not seem to be looking downward, as though he had climbed the steps often
//enough to have no need of vision.

// 13494
//The boy knew that he should have been curious, or frightened, but there was no
//spare brain capacity for that. It was taking all his control not to let the
//fury simmering inside him boil over any further than it already had.

// 13495
//The stairs went on for only a short distance, one straight rising flight
//without turns or curves.

// 13496
//At the top was a door of solid metal, looking black in the blue light cast from
//Harry’s wand, meaning that the metal itself was either black or perhaps red.

// 13497
//Albus Dumbledore lifted up his long wand like a brandished symbol, and again
//spoke in that strange voice which seemed to echo in Harry’s ears, as though
//burning itself into his memory: “__Phoenix’s fate.__”

// 13498
//That last door opened, and Harry followed Dumbledore inside.

// 13499
//The room beyond seemed to be made of black metal like the door that led to it.
//The walls were black, the floor was black. The ceiling above was black, but for
//a single globe of crystal that hung down from the ceiling on a white chain, and
//shone with a brilliant silver light that looked like it had been cast in
//imitation of Patronus light, though you could tell it wasn’t the real thing.

// 13500
//Within the room were pedestals of black metal, each bearing a moving picture,
//or an upright cylinder half-filled with some faintly shining silver liquid, or
//a lone small object; a scorched silver necklace, a crushed hat, an untouched
//golden wedding ring. Many pedestals bore all three, the moving picture and the
//silver liquid and the item. There seemed to be a good many wizards’ wands upon
//those pedestals, and many of those wands were broken, or burned, or looked like
//the wood had somehow melted.

// 13501
//It took that long for Harry to realize what he was seeing, and then his throat
//suddenly choked; it was like the rage inside him had been hit a hammerblow,
//maybe the hardest hammerblow of his entire existence.

// 13502
//“These are not all the fallen of all my wars,” Albus Dumbledore said. His back
//was to Harry, only his grey locks and yellowish robes showed. “Not even nearly
//all of them. Only my closest friends, and those who died of my worst decisions,
//there is something of them here. Those I regret most of all, this is their
//place.”

// 13503
//Harry couldn’t count how many pedestals were in the room. It might have been
//around a hundred. The room of black metal was not small, and there was clearly
//more space left in it for future pedestals.

// 13504
//Albus Dumbledore turned and regarded Harry, the deep blue eyes set like steel
//in his brow, but his voice, when he spoke, was calm. “It seems to me that you
//know nothing of the phoenix’s price,” Albus Dumbledore said quietly. “It seems
//to me that you are not an evil person, but most terribly ignorant, and
//confident in your ignorance; as I once was, a long time ago. Yet I have never
//heard Fawkes so clearly as you seemed to, that day. Perhaps I was already too
//old and full of grief, when my phoenix came to me. If there is something I do
//not understand, about how ready I should be to fight, then tell me of this
//wisdom.” There was no anger in the old wizard’s voice; the impact that drove
//out your breath like falling off a broomstick was all in the scorched and
//shattered wands, gleaming gently in their death beneath the silver light. “Or
//else turn and go from this place, but then I wish to hear no more of it.”

// 13505
//Harry didn’t know what to say. There had been nothing in his own life that was
//like this, and all the words seemed to fall away. He would find something to
//say if he looked, but he couldn’t believe, in that moment, that the words would
//be meaningful. You shouldn’t be able to win any possible argument, just from
//people having died of your decisions, and yet even knowing that it felt like
//there was nothing to be said. That there was nothing Harry had any right to
//say.

// 13506
//And Harry almost did turn and go from that place, except for the understanding
//which came to him then: that there was probably a part of Albus Dumbledore
//which always stood in this place, always, no matter where he was. And that if
//you stood in a place like this you could do anything, __lose__ anything,
//if it meant that you didn’t have to fight another time.

// 13507
//One of the pedestals caught Harry’s eye; the photograph on it did not move, did
//not smile or wave, it was a Muggle photograph of a woman looking seriously at
//the camera, her brown hair twisted into braids of an ordinary Muggle style that
//Harry hadn’t seen on any witch. There was a cylinder of silvery liquid beside
//the photograph, but no object; no melted ring or broken wand.

// 13508
//Harry walked forward, slowly, until he stood before the pedestal. “Who was
//she?” Harry said, his voice sounding strange in his own ears.

// 13509
//“Her name was Tricia Glasswell,” said Dumbledore. “The mother of a Muggleborn
//daughter, who the Death Eaters killed. She was a detective of the Muggle
//government, and after that she fed information from the Muggle authorities to
//the Order of the Phoenix, until she was - betrayed - into the hands of
//Voldemort.” There was a catch in the old wizard’s voice. “She did not die well,
//Harry.”

// 13510
//“Did she save lives?” Harry said.

// 13511
//“Yes,” the wizard said quietly. “She did.”

// 13512
//Harry lifted his gaze from the pedestal to look at Dumbledore. “Would the world
//be a better place if she hadn’t fought?”

// 13513
//“No, it would not,” said the old wizard. His voice was tired, and grieving. He
//seemed more bent now, as though he were folding in on himself. “I see that you
//still do not understand. I think you will not understand until the day that you
//- oh, Harry. So very long ago, when I was not much older than you are now, I
//learned the true face of violence, and its cost. To fill the air with deadly
//curses - for any reason - for __any __reason, Harry - it is an ill thing,
//and its nature is corrupted, as terrible as the darkest rituals. Violence, once
//begun, becomes like a Lethifold that strikes at any life near it. I… would
//spare you that lesson the way I learned it, Harry.”

// 13514
//Harry looked away from the blue eyes, cast his gaze down at the black metal of
//the floor. The Headmaster was trying to tell him something important, that was
//clear; and it wasn’t something that Harry thought was stupid, either.

// 13515
//“There was a Muggle once named Mohandas Gandhi,” Harry said to the floor. “He
//thought the government of Muggle Britain shouldn’t rule over his country. And
//he refused to fight. He convinced his whole country not to fight. Instead he
//told his people to walk up to the British soldiers and let themselves be struck
//down, without resisting, and when Britain couldn’t stand doing that any more,
//we freed his country. I thought it was a very beautiful thing, when I read
//about it, I thought it was something higher than all the wars that anyone had
//ever fought with guns or swords. That they’d really done that, and that it had
//__actually worked.__” Harry drew another breath. “Only then I found out
//that Gandhi told his people, during World War II, that if the Nazis invaded
//they should use nonviolent resistance against them, too. But the Nazis would’ve
//just shot everyone in sight. And maybe Winston Churchill always felt that there
//should’ve been a better way, some clever way to win without having to hurt
//anyone; but he never found it, and so he had to fight.” Harry looked up at the
//Headmaster, who was staring at him. “Winston Churchill was the one who tried to
//convince the British government __not__ to give Czechoslovakia to Hitler
//in exchange for a peace treaty, that they should fight right away -”

// 13516
//“I recognize the name, Harry,” said Dumbledore. The old wizard’s lips twitched
//upward. “Although honesty compels me to say that dear Winston was never one for
//pangs of conscience, even after a dozen shots of Firewhiskey.”

// 13517
//“The point is,” Harry said, after a brief pause to remember exactly who he was
//talking to, and fight down the suddenly returning sense that he was an ignorant
//child gone insane with audacity who had no right to be in this room and no
//right to question Albus Dumbledore about anything, “the point is, saying
//violence is evil isn’t an __answer.__ It doesn’t say when to fight and
//when not to fight. It’s a hard question and Gandhi refused to deal with it, and
//that’s why I lost some of my respect for him.”

// 13518
//“And your own answer, Harry?” Dumbledore said quietly.

// 13519
//“One answer is that you shouldn’t ever use violence except to stop violence,”
//Harry said. “You shouldn’t risk anyone’s life except to save even more lives.
//It __sounds__ good when you say it like that. Only the problem is that if
//a police officer sees a burglar robbing a house, the police officer
//__should__ try to stop the burglar, even though the burglar might fight
//back and someone might get hurt or even killed. Even if the burglar is only
//trying to steal jewelry, which is just a __thing.__ Because if nobody so
//much as __inconveniences__ burglars, there will be __more__ burglars,
//and __more__ burglars. And even if they only ever stole __things__
//each time, it would - the fabric of society -” Harry stopped. His thoughts
//weren’t as ordered as they usually pretended to be, in this room. He should
//have been able to give some perfectly logical exposition in terms of game
//theory, should have at least been able to __see__ it that way, but it was
//eluding him. Hawks and doves - “Don’t you see, if evil people are willing to
//risk violence to get what they want, and good people always back down because
//violence is too terrible to risk, it’s - it’s not a good society to live in,
//Headmaster! Don’t you realize what all this bullying is doing to Hogwarts, to
//Slytherin House most of all?”

// 13520
//“__War__ is too terrible to risk,” the old wizard said. “And yet it will
//come. Voldemort is returning. The black chesspieces are gathering. Severus is
//one of the most important pieces our own side possesses, in that war. But our
//evil Potions Master must, as the saying goes, keep up appearances. If Severus
//can pay that keep by hurting the feelings of children, only their feelings,
//Harry,” the old wizard’s voice was very soft, “you would have to be most
//terribly innocent in the ways of war, to think he had made a poor bargain. Hard
//decisions do not look like __that__, Harry. They look - like this.” The
//old wizard did not gesture. He simply stood where he was, among the pedestals.

// 13521
//“You shouldn’t be Headmaster,” Harry said through the burning in his throat.
//“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, but you shouldn’t try to be a school principal and
//run a war at the same time. Hogwarts shouldn’t be part of this.”

// 13522
//“The children will survive,” the old wizard said with tired old eyes. “They
//would not survive Voldemort. Have you wondered why the children of Hogwarts do
//not speak much of their parents, Harry? It is because there is always, within
//earshot, someone who has lost their mother or father or both. That is what
//Voldemort left behind, the last time he came. __Nothing__ is worth that
//war beginning again even one day earlier than it must, or lasting one day
//longer than it must.” The old wizard did gesture now, as though to indicate all
//the shattered wands. “We did not fight because it seemed righteous to do so! We
//fought when we had to, when there was no other way left. That was our answer.”

// 13523
//“Is that why you waited so long to confront Grindelwald?”

// 13524
//Harry had uttered the question without quite thinking -

// 13525
//There was a slow time while the blue eyes searched him.

// 13526
//“Who have you been talking to, Harry?” said the old wizard. “No, do not answer.
//I already know.” Dumbledore sighed. “Many have asked me that question, and
//always I have turned them aside. Yet in time you must learn the full truth of
//that matter. Will you swear never to speak of it to another, until I give you
//leave?”

// 13527
//Harry would have liked to be allowed to tell Draco, but - “I swear,” Harry
//said.

// 13528
//“Grindelwald possessed an ancient and terrible device,” said Dumbledore. “While
//he held it, I could not break his defense. In our duel I could not win, only
//fight him for long hours until he fell in exhaustion; and I would have died of
//it afterward, if not for Fawkes. But while his Muggle allies yet made blood
//sacrifice to sustain him, Grindelwald would __not __have fallen. He was,
//during that time, truly invincible. Of that grim device which Grindelwald held,
//none must know, none must suspect, there must be not a single hint. And
//therefore you must not speak of it, and I will say no more for now. That is
//all, Harry. There is no moral to it, and no wisdom. That is all there is.”

// 13529
//Harry slowly nodded. It wasn’t entirely implausible, by the standards of magic…

// 13530
//“And then,” Dumbledore’s voice went on, even quieter, almost as though he were
//speaking to himself, “since it was I who felled him, they obeyed me when I said
//he should not die, though they cried by the thousands for his blood. So he was
//imprisoned in Nurmengard, in the prison that he built, and he abides there
//until this day. I went to that duel without any intent to kill him, Harry.
//Because, you see, I had tried to kill Grindelwald once before, a long time ago,
//and that… that was… it proved to be… a mistake, Harry…” The old wizard was
//staring now at his long dark-grey wand where he held it in both hands, as
//though it were a crystal ball out of Muggle fantasy, a scrying pool within
//which answers could be found. “And I thought, then… I thought that I should
//never kill. And then came Voldemort.”

// 13531
//The old wizard looked back up at Harry, and said, in a hoarse voice, “He is not
//like Grindelwald, Harry. There is nothing human left in him. __Him__ you
//must destroy. You must not hesitate, when the time comes. To him alone, of all
//the creatures in this world, you must show no mercy; and when you are done you
//must forget it, forget that you ever did such a thing, and go back to living.
//Save your fury for that, and that alone.”

// 13532
//In that office there was silence.

// 13533
//It lasted for some many long seconds, and finally was broken by a single
//question.

// 13534
//“Are there Dementors in Nurmengard?”

// 13535
//“What?” said the old wizard. “No! I would not have done that even to him -”

// 13536
//The old wizard stared at the young boy, who had straightened, and his face
//changed.

// 13537
//“In other words,” the boy said, as though talking to himself without any other
//people in the room, “it’s already known how to keep powerful Dark Wizards in
//prison, without using Dementors. People __know__ they know that.”

// 13538
//“Harry…?”

// 13539
//“No,” the boy said. The boy looked up, and his eyes were blazing like green
//fire. “I do not accept your answer, Headmaster. Fawkes gave me a mission, and I
//know now why Fawkes gave that mission to me, and not to you. You are willing to
//accept balances of power where the bad guys end up winning. I am not.”

// 13540
//“That too is not an answer,” the old wizard said; his face showed nothing of
//his hurt, he had long practice in concealing pain. “Refusing to accept
//something does not change it. I wonder now if you are simply too young to
//understand this matter, Harry, despite your outward airs; only in children’s
//fantasies can all battles be won, and not a single evil tolerated.”

// 13541
//“And that’s why I can destroy Dementors and you can’t,” said the boy. “Because
//I believe that the darkness can be broken.”

// 13542
//The old wizard’s breath stopped in his throat.

// 13543
//“The phoenix’s price isn’t inevitable,” the boy said. “It’s not part of some
//deep balance built into the universe. It’s just the parts of the problem where
//you haven’t figured out yet how to cheat.”

// 13544
//The old wizard’s lips parted, and no words came forth.

// 13545
//Silver light falling on shattered wands.

// 13546
//“Fawkes gave me a mission,” the boy repeated, “and I will carry out that
//mission if I must break the entire Ministry to do it. That’s the part of the
//answer that you’re missing. You don’t stop and say, __oh well, guess I
//can’t possibly figure out any way to stop bullying in Hogwarts, __and
//__leave__ it at that. You just keep looking until you figure out how to do
//it. If that requires breaking Lucius Malfoy’s entire conspiracy,
//__fine.__”

// 13547
//“And the true fight, the fight against Voldemort?” the old wizard said in an
//unsteady voice. “What will you do to win __that__, Harry? Will you break
//the whole world? Even if someday you gain such power, you are not yet beyond
//prices, and perhaps you never will be! For you to act this way __now__ is
//nothing short of madness!”

// 13548
//“I asked Professor Quirrell why he’d laughed,” the boy said evenly, “after he
//awarded Hermione those hundred points. And Professor Quirrell said, these
//aren’t his exact words, but it’s pretty much what he said, that he’d found it
//tremendously amusing that the great and good Albus Dumbledore had been sitting
//there doing nothing as this poor innocent girl begged for help, while
//__he__ had been the one to defend her. And he told me then that by the
//time good and moral people were done tying themselves up in knots, what they
//usually did was nothing; or, if they did act, you could hardly tell them apart
//from the people called bad. Whereas __he__ could help innocent girls any
//time he felt like it, because he wasn’t a good person. And that I ought to
//remember that, any time I considered growing up to be good.”

// 13549
//The old wizard did not show the force of the blow. Only a slight widening of
//his eyes would have betrayed it, if you had been watching him very closely.

// 13550
//“Don’t worry, Headmaster,” said the boy. “I haven’t gotten my wires crossed. I
//know that I’m supposed to learn goodness from Hermione and Fawkes, not from
//Professor Quirrell and you. Which brings me to the actual reason why I came
//here. Hermione’s time is too valuable to waste in detentions. Professor Snape
//will revoke it, claiming that I blackmailed him.”

// 13551
//After a hesitation the old wizard nodded his head, the silver beard swaying
//slowly beneath. “That would not be best for __her,__ Harry,” the old
//wizard said. “But the detention can be put down as being served with Professor
//Binns, and you and she can study together in his classroom.”

// 13552
//“Fine,” the boy said. “I think that was all the business we had together, in
//the end. You may expect, the next time you seem to be working on the side of
//the bad guys or letting them win, that I will do whatever I think Fawkes would
//tell me to, regardless of how much trouble comes of it. I hope we’re both clear
//on that.”

// 13553
//Without another word, the boy turned and walked out of the room, through the
//open door of black metal, the words “__Lumos!__” and the light of his wand
//following a moment later.

// 13554
//The old wizard stood there silent, silent amid the ruins of the lives which his
//own life had left behind. His wrinkled hand rose, shaking, to touch at his
//half-moon glasses -

// 13555
//The boy poked his head back in. “Would you mind switching on the stairs,
//Headmaster? I’d rather not go through all the work again to leave the same way
//I came.”

// 13556
//“Go, Harry Potter,” the old wizard said. “The stairs will receive you.”

// 13557
//(Some time later, an earlier version of Harry, who had invisibly waited next to
//the gargoyles since 9PM, followed the Deputy Headmistress through the opening
//that parted for her, stood quietly behind her on the turning stairs until they
//came to the top, and then, still under the Cloak, spun his Time-Turner thrice.)

// 13558
//__Aftermath: Professor Quirrell and -__

// 13559
//In a shadowy clearing the Defense Professor waited, his back leaned negligently
//against the rough grey bark of a towering beech tree as yet unleaved in the
//late March days, so that its trunk and crown seemed like a pale arm reaching up
//from the ground and exploding into a hand of a thousand fingers. Around the
//Defense Professor and above him were branches so dense that even in the
//earliest spring, with few trees so much as budding, you could have hardly seen
//the sky from the ground. The strands of the wooden net crossed and proliferated
//so many times that if you were on a broomstick above, searching for someone
//below, you would have found it easier to follow your ears than your eyes. Nor
//would it have helped that it was almost dark amid the prohibited woods, the
//unseen sun almost set, so that only a few glows of fading sunlight illuminated
//the tops of the tallest trees.

// 13560
//Then came the faintest sound of footsteps, almost inaudible even on the forest
//ground; the gait of a man accustomed to passing unseen. No twig snapped, nor
//leaf rustled -

// 13561
//“Good afternoon,” said Professor Quirrell. The Defense Professor did not
//trouble to move his eyes, or his hands from where they rested negligently at
//his side.

// 13562
//A figure clad in a black cloak shimmered into existence, his head turning to
//look left and then right. In the figure’s right hand, gripped low, was a wand
//of wood so grey it was almost silver.

// 13563
//“I do not know why you wished to meet __here__ of all places,” said
//Severus Snape, his voice cool.

// 13564
//“Oh,” Professor Quirrell said idly, as though the whole matter was of the least
//importance, “I thought you would prefer privacy. The walls of Hogwarts have
//ears, and you would not wish the Headmaster to know of your role in yesterday’s
//affair, would you?”

// 13565
//The March chill seemed to grow deeper, the temperature further fall. “I don’t
//know what you’re talking about,” the Potions Master said icily.

// 13566
//“You know perfectly well what we’re talking about,” said Professor Quirrell in
//an amused voice. “Really, my good Professor, you should not meddle in the
//affairs of idiots unless you are ready to defend yourself upon the instant from
//all their violence.” (The Defense Professor’s hands still lay relaxed and open
//at his side.) “And yet none of those idiots seem to remember the sight of you
//falling, nor do the young ladies recall your presence. Which raises the
//fascinating question of why you would go to the extraordinary length, I dare
//say the __desperate__ length, of casting __fifty-two__ Memory
//Charms.” Professor Quirrell tilted his head. “Would you fear so much the
//opinions of mere students? I think not. Would you dread the matter becoming
//known to your good friend, Lord Malfoy? But those fools, upon the very spot,
//invented a quite satisfactory excuse for your presence. No, there is only one
//person who holds so much power over you, and who would be most perturbed to
//find you executing any plot without his knowledge. Your true and hidden master,
//Albus Dumbledore.”

// 13567
//“__What?__” hissed the Potions Master, the anger plain upon his face.

// 13568
//“But now, it seems, you are moving on your own; and so I find myself most
//intrigued as to what you could __possibly__ be doing, and why.” The
//Defense Professor regarded the black-clad silhouette of the Potions Master with
//the scrutiny a man might give an exceptionally interesting bug, even if it was
//still ultimately just a bug.

// 13569
//“I am no servant of Dumbledore’s,” the Potions Master said coldly.

// 13570
//“Really? What astonishing news.” The Defense Professor smiled slightly. “Do
//tell me all about it.”

// 13571
//There was a long pause. From some tree an owl hooted, the sound huge in the
//silence; neither man startled or flinched.

// 13572
//“You don’t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,” Severus Snape said, his voice very
//soft.

// 13573
//“I don’t?” said Professor Quirrell. “How would you know?”

// 13574
//“On the other hand,” the Potions Master continued, voice still soft, “my
//friends enjoy many advantages.”

// 13575
//The man leaning against the grey bark raised his eyebrows. “Such as?”

// 13576
//“There is much that I know of this school,” said the Potions Master. “Things
//you might not think I knew.”

// 13577
//There was an expectant pause.

// 13578
//“How incredibly fascinating,” said Professor Quirrell. The man was examining
//his fingernails with a bored look. “Do go on.”

// 13579
//“I know you have been… __investigating…__ the third-floor corridor -”

// 13580
//“You know nothing of the sort.” The man’s back straightened against the wood.
//“Do not bluff against me, Severus Snape; I find it annoying, and you are in no
//position to annoy me. A single glance would tell any competent wizard that the
//Headmaster has laced that corridor with a ridiculous quantity of wards and
//webs, triggers and tripsigns. And more: there are Charms laid there of ancient
//power, magical constructs of which I have heard not even rumors, techniques
//that must have been disgorged from the hoarded lore of Flamel himself. Even
//He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named would have had trouble passing those without notice.”
//Professor Quirrell tapped a thoughtful finger on his cheek. “And for the actual
//lock, a __Colloportus__ laid on an ordinary doorknob, cast so weakly that
//it could not have kept out Miss Granger on the day she entered Hogwarts. Never
//before in my existence have I encountered such a blatant trap.” Now the Defense
//Professor narrowed his eyes. “I know of no one left in the world against whom
//such fantastic feats of detection would serve any useful purpose. If there is
//some wizard possessed of ancient lore, of whom I know nothing, against whom
//this trap is set - you may trade __that__ information for as much silence
//as you like, my dear Professor, and a good serving of my favor left over
//afterward.”

// 13581
//You could have sworn that Professor Quirrell was watching Severus Snape with
//keen interest. Not the faintest trace of a smile crossed the man’s lips.

// 13582
//There was another long silence in the clearing.

// 13583
//“I do not know __who__ Dumbledore fears,” Snape said. “But I know what
//bait he has set out, and somewhat of how it is truly guarded -”

// 13584
//“As to that,” said Professor Quirrell, sounding bored again, “I stole it months
//ago, and left a fake in its place. But thank you kindly for asking.”

// 13585
//“You’re lying,” said Severus Snape after a pause.

// 13586
//“Yes, I am.” Professor Quirrell leaned back against the grey wood again, his
//eyes drifting up to the dense net of branches, the falling night scarcely
//visible between the complex crossings. “I simply wished to learn whether you
//would call me on it, since you are pretending to know so little.” The Defense
//Professor smiled to himself.

// 13587
//The Potions Master looked like he was about to choke on his own fury.
//“__What do you want?__”

// 13588
//“Nothing, really,” said the Defense Professor, continuing to gaze at the forest
//ceiling. “I was only curious. I suppose I shall just watch and see where your
//plotting goes, and meanwhile I will say nothing to the Headmaster - so long as
//you are willing to do me a favor now and then, of course.” A dry smile crossed
//the face. “You are dismissed for now, Severus Snape. Though I wouldn’t mind
//having another little chat soon, if you’re willing to speak with me honestly of
//where your loyalties lie. And I do mean __honestly,__ not the false faces
//you’ve shown today. You might find you have more allies than you thought. Take
//some time to think it over, my friend.”

// 13589
//__Aftermath: Draco Malfoy and -__

// 13590
//A rainbow hemisphere, a dome of solid force with little chromaticity of its own
//which sent back the infringing light in splintered reflections, iridescent in
//many colors, as it fractured the shine of the many-splendored chandeliers of
//the Slytherin common room.

// 13591
//Sheltered beneath the rainbow hemisphere, the terrified face of a young witch
//who had never fought bullies, who had not joined any of Professor Quirrell’s
//armies, who was getting Acceptable marks at best in her Defense class, who
//could not have cast a Prismatic Barrier even to save her own life.

// 13592
//“Oh, stop it,” said Draco Malfoy, making his voice sound bored despite the
//sweat that had broken out underneath his robes, as he kept his wand pointed at
//the barrier that was sheltering Millicent Bulstrode.

// 13593
//He couldn’t remember making the decision, there’d just been the two older boys
//about to hex Millicent, the common room silently staring, and then Draco’s hand
//had just drawn his wand and cast the barrier, leaving his heart to pump itself
//full of shocked adrenaline while his poor sad brain frantically racked itself
//for explanations -

// 13594
//The two older boys were straightening up from where they’d been looming over
//Millicent, turning to Draco, looking at him with a mixture of shock and anger.
//Gregory and Vincent beside him had already drawn their own wands, but weren’t
//pointing them. All three of them together couldn’t have won, anyway.

// 13595
//But the older boys wouldn’t hex him. Nobody could possibly be stupid enough to
//hex the next Lord Malfoy.

// 13596
//It wasn’t fear of being hexed that was making Draco sweat beneath his robes, as
//he desperately hoped the beads of water weren’t visible on his forehead.

// 13597
//Draco was sweating because of the dawning and sickening certainty that even if
//he got away with this now, if he kept down this path, there would come a time
//when it would all come crashing down; and then he might not be the next Lord
//Malfoy anymore.

// 13598
//“Mr. Malfoy,” said the oldest-looking boy. “Why are you protecting her?”

// 13599
//“So you’ve located the mistress of the conspiracy,” Draco said with a Number
//Two Sneer, “and it’s, let me get this straight now, a first-year girl named
//Millicent Bulstrode. She’s just a __conduit__, you __niddlewit!__”

// 13600
//“So?” demanded the older boy. “She still helped them!”

// 13601
//Draco lifted his wand and the Prismatic Sphere winked out. Still talking in a
//bored voice, Draco said, “__Did__ you know what you were doing, Miss
//Bulstrode?”

// 13602
//“N-no,” Millicent stammered from where she was still sitting at her desk.

// 13603
//“Did you know where the Slytherin messages you were passing on were going to?”

// 13604
//“No!” said Millicent.

// 13605
//“Thank you,” Draco said. “All of you please leave her alone, she’s just a pawn.
//Miss Bulstrode, you may consider the favor you did me in February to have been
//repaid.” And Draco turned back to his Potions homework, hoping to Merlin and
//back again that Millicent didn’t say anything incredibly stupid like ‘What
//favor?’ -

// 13606
//“Then why,” a voice said clearly from across the room, “did those witches go
//where a note from Millicent told them to go?”

// 13607
//Sweating even more, Draco lifted his head again to look at where Randolph Lee
//had spoken. “What did the fake note say exactly?” said Draco. “Was it, ‘I
//command you to go forth in the name of the Dark Lady Bulstrode’ or ‘Please meet
//me here, sincerely Millicent?’”

// 13608
//Randolph Lee opened his mouth, hesitated for a fractional second -

// 13609
//“I thought so,” said Draco. “That wasn’t a very good test, Mr. Lee, it - it can
//-” A frantic, nerve-racking moment while he figured out how to say it without
//using Harry-words like __false positive.__ “It can get the witches to go
//there if any of them is just __friends__ with Millicent.”

// 13610
//As though the matter had been entirely settled, Draco looked down again at his
//Potions homework, ignoring (except for the feeling of sick dread in his
//stomach) the whispers from around the room.

// 13611
//It was only out of the corner of his eye that he caught Gregory staring at him.

// 13612
//Draco’s eyes rested on his Astronomy homework, but he couldn’t make his mind
//focus there. If you were trying not to think about things Harry Potter had
//said, pretty much the worst possible thing you could do was look at your
//textbook’s pictures of the night sky, and try to remember what you__
//weren’t__ supposed to know about how the planets wandered. Astronomy, a noble
//and prestigious art, a sign of learning and knowledge; only Muggles possessed
//secret modern artifacts which could do it a million billion times better using
//methods that Harry had tried to explain and which Draco still couldn’t begin to
//understand except that apparently it didn’t even take __magic__ to make
//__things__ do __Arithmancy.__

// 13613
//Draco looked at the pictures of constellations, and wondered if it was like
//this in the other Houses, if people were always threatening each other in
//Ravenclaw.

// 13614
//Harry Potter had told him once that soldiers on a battlefield didn’t really
//fight for their country. Patriotism might get them to the battlefield in the
//first place, but once they were there, they fought to protect __each
//other,__ the friends they’d trained with who were right in front of them. And
//Harry had observed, and Draco had known that it was true, that you couldn’t use
//loyalty to a leader to power a Patronus Charm, it wasn’t __quite__ the
//right kind of warm and happy thought. But thinking of protecting someone beside
//you -

// 13615
//That, Harry Potter had said thoughtfully, was probably why the Death Eaters had
//fallen apart the moment the Dark Lord had departed. They hadn’t been warm
//enough to __each other__.

// 13616
//You could recruit a group that included Bellatrix Black and Amycus Carrow
//alongside Lord Malfoy and Mr. MacNair, and keep them in line with the Cruciatus
//Curse. But the instant the master of the Dark Mark was gone, you didn’t have an
//army anymore, you had a circle of acquaintances. That was why Father had
//failed. It hadn’t even really been his fault. There’d been nothing Father
//__could__ have done, after inheriting Death Eaters who weren’t really
//__friends__ with each other.

// 13617
//And even though it was Slytherin House he was supposed to defend - Slytherin
//House which he and Harry had formed a pact to __save__ - sometimes Draco
//couldn’t help but think that it was just less __wearisome__ when he was
//leading army practices. When he was working with students from the other three
//Houses that weren’t Slytherin. Once you saw and named the problems, you
//couldn’t __stop__ seeing them, it just got more __annoying__ every
//day.

// 13618
//“Mr. Malfoy?” said the voice of Gregory Goyle, from where he was lying on the
//floor beside Draco’s desk, in the small but private bedroom; Gregory was doing
//his Transfiguration homework, on which he often needed help.

// 13619
//Any distraction was welcome at this point. “Yes?” said Draco.

// 13620
//“You weren’t really plotting against Granger at all,” said Gregory. “Were you?”

// 13621
//The sensation spreading through Draco’s stomach felt just like Gregory’s voice
//sounded, sickened and afraid.

// 13622
//“You actually were helping Granger, that day you picked her up off the floor,”
//said Gregory. “And before, that time you kept her from falling off the roof.
//You __helped__ a __mudblood__ -”

// 13623
//“Yeah, right,” said Draco sarcastically, without the slightest hesitation or
//delay, looking back down at his Astronomy homework like he wasn’t the least bit
//nervous. It was all happening the way Draco had feared it would, but at least
//that meant he’d played this conversation in his head over and over, coming up
//with the right opening gambit. “Come on, Gregory, you’ve dueled General
//Granger, you __know__ how strong her spells are. Like a real Muggle-spawn
//is going to be more powerful than you, more powerful than Theodore, more
//powerful than every single pureblood in our whole school year except me? Don’t
//you actually __believe__ in anything Father says? She’s __adopted.__
//Her parents died in the war and someone stuck her with a couple of Muggles to
//hide her. No __way__ is General Granger a real mudblood.”

// 13624
//A slow pulse of silence through Draco’s bedroom. Draco wanted to know, needed
//to know what look was on Gregory’s face. But he __couldn’t__ look up from
//his desk, not yet, not until Gregory spoke first.

// 13625
//And then -

// 13626
//“Is __that__ what Harry Potter said to you?” said Gregory.

// 13627
//The voice wavered, and broke. When Draco looked up from his homework, he saw
//that tears were leaking out of Gregory’s eyes.

// 13628
//Apparently that hadn’t worked.

// 13629
//“I don’t know what to do,” Gregory said in a whisper. “I don’t know what to do
//now, Mr. Malfoy. Your father isn’t - when he finds out - he’s not going to like
//it, Mr. Malfoy!”

// 13630
//__It’s not __your__ job to decide what Father will like, Goyle -__

// 13631
//Draco could hear the words in his head; they sounded in Father’s voice, with
//the same sternness. It was the sort of thing Father had __told__ him to
//say, if Vincent or Gregory ever questioned him; and if that didn’t work he was
//to hex them. They were __not__ equal friends, Father had said, and he
//wasn’t ever to forget it. Draco was in charge, they were his servants, and if
//Draco couldn’t keep it that way then he wasn’t fit to inherit House Malfoy…

// 13632
//“It’s all right, Gregory,” Draco said, as gently as he could. “All you’ve got
//to do is worry about protecting me. Nobody’s going to blame you for following
//my orders, not my father, not yours.” Putting all the warmth he could into his
//voice, like trying to cast a Patronus Charm. “And anyway, the next war isn’t
//going to be the same as the last one. House Malfoy was around long before the
//Dark Lord, and not every Lord Malfoy does the same thing. Father knows that.”

// 13633
//“Does he?” said Gregory in trembling voice. “Does he __really?__”

// 13634
//Draco nodded. “Professor Quirrell knows it too,” said Draco. “That’s what the
//armies are about. The Defense Professor’s right, when the next war comes,
//Father won’t be able to unite the whole country, they’ll remember the
//__last__ war. But anyone who’s fought in Professor Quirrell’s armies will
//remember who the strongest generals were, they’ll know who’s worthy to lead
//them. They’ll proclaim Harry Potter their Lord, and I’ll be his right hand, and
//House Malfoy will come out on top, like always. People might even turn to
//__me,__ if Potter isn’t there, so long as they think I’m trustworthy.
//That’s what I’m setting up now. Father will understand.”

// 13635
//Gregory reached up and wiped his eyes, looking down again at his
//Transfiguration homework. “Okay,” Gregory said in a shaky voice. “If you say
//so, Mr. Malfoy.”

// 13636
//Draco nodded again, ignoring the hollow feeling inside himself at the lies he’d
//just told his friend, and turned back to the stars.

// 13637
//__Aftermath: Hermione Granger and -__

// 13638
//Being invisible should’ve been more __interesting__ than this, the
//corridors of Hogwarts should have been outlined in strange colors or something.
//But actually, Hermione thought, being under Harry’s invisibility cloak was
//exactly like __not__ being under an invisibility cloak, except for the
//cloak part. When you pulled the veil of soft black cloth down from the hood and
//over your face, you couldn’t even see it stretching in front of you, and
//afterward it didn’t seem to impede your breathing. And the world looked just
//the same, except that when you walked past things of metal, you didn’t see any
//small reflections of yourself. Portraits never looked at you, only did whatever
//strange things they did when they were alone. Hermione hadn’t tried walking
//past a mirror yet, she wasn’t sure she __wanted__ to. Most of all, there
//was no __you__ anymore as you walked around, no hands, no feet, just a
//changing point of view. It was an unnerving feeling, not so much of being
//__invisible__ as of __not existing.__

// 13639
//Harry hadn’t questioned her at all, she’d just got out the word ‘invisibility’
//and then Harry was drawing his invisibility cloak from his pouch. She hadn’t
//even been given a chance to explain about her extremely secret meeting with
//Daphne and Millicent Bulstrode, or that she thought it would help protect the
//other girls, Harry had just handed over what was probably a Deathly Hallow. If
//you were fair, and she __did__ try to be fair, she had to admit that
//sometimes Harry could be a very true, true friend.

// 13640
//The secret meeting itself had been a great big failure.

// 13641
//Millicent had claimed to be a seer.

// 13642
//Hermione had carefully explained to Millicent and Daphne at considerable length
//that this could not possibly be true.

// 13643
//She and Harry had looked up Divination early on in their research; Harry had
//insisted that they read everything they could find about prophecies that wasn’t
//in the Restricted Section. As Harry had observed, it would save a lot of effort
//if they could just get a seer to prophesy everything they would figure out
//thirty-five years later. (Or to put it in Harry’s terms, any means of obtaining
//information transmitted from the distant future was potentially an instant
//global victory condition.)

// 13644
//But, as Hermione had explained to Millicent, prophesying wasn’t controllable,
//there was no way to __ask__ for a prophecy about anything in particular.
//Instead (the books had said) there was a sort of __pressure__ that built
//up in Time, when some huge event was trying to happen, or stop itself from
//happening. And seers were like weak points that let out the pressure, when the
//right listener was nearby. So prophecies were only about big, important things,
//because only that generated enough pressure; and you almost never got more than
//one seer saying the same thing, because afterward the pressure was gone. And,
//as Hermione had further explained to Millicent, the seers themselves didn’t
//remember their prophecies, because the message wasn’t for __them__. And
//the messages would come out in riddles, and only someone who heard the prophecy
//in the seer’s original voice would hear all the meaning that was in the riddle.
//There was no __possible __way that Millicent could just give out a
//prophecy __any time she wanted__, about __school bullies__, and then
//__remember __it, and if she __had__ it would’ve come out as ‘the
//skeleton is the key’ and not ‘Susan Bones has to be there’.

// 13645
//Millicent had been looking rather frightened at this point, so Hermione had
//relaxed her fists where they’d been jammed on her hips, calmed herself down,
//and stated carefully that she was glad Millicent had helped them, but they
//__had__ sometimes walked into traps following what Millicent said, and so
//Hermione really did want to know where the messages had __actually__ come
//from.

// 13646
//And Millicent had said in a small voice:

// 13647
//__But, but she told __me__ that she was a seer…__

// 13648
//Hermione had told Daphne not to press it, after Millicent had refused to give
//up her source. It wasn’t just that Hermione had felt awful about the scared
//look on Millicent’s face. It was that Hermione had a strong feeling that if
//they __did__ find the person who’d been telling Millicent things, why,
//__they__ would turn out to just be finding envelopes under their pillow in
//the morning.

// 13649
//She was getting that same despairing feeling she’d gotten in the battle before
//Christmas, looking at Zabini’s charts with all the colored lines and boxes and…
//and she had only just now realized what it meant that __Zabini__ had been
//the one showing her that chart.

// 13650
//Even for a Ravenclaw, she felt, there was such a thing as having your life get
//overly complicated.

// 13651
//Hermione began ascending a short spiral of yellow marble steps protruding from
//a central spine, a poorly-kept “secret” staircase that was actually one of the
//fastest ways up from the Slytherin dungeons to the Ravenclaw tower, but which
//only witches could traverse. (Why girls in particular needed a quick way to
//move from Ravenclaw to Slytherin and back was something Hermione found a bit
//puzzling.) At the top of the staircase, now that she was away from Slytherin
//places and back into the main parts of Hogwarts, Hermione stopped and took off
//Harry’s invisibility cloak.

// 13652
//After her pouch had swallowed the cloak, Hermione turned right and started to
//walk down a short passageway, now automatically keeping an eye out in all
//directions without really thinking about it, and her constantly-scanning eyes
//glanced into a shadowy alcove -

// 13653
//__(fleeting disorientation)__

// 13654
//- and then a rush of shock and fear hit her like a Stunning Hex over her whole
  //body, she found that without any thought or any conscious decision her wand
//had leaped into her hand and was already pointed at…

// 13655
//…a black cloak so wide and billowing that it was impossible to determine
//whether the figure beneath was male or female, and atop the cloak a
//broad-brimmed black hat; and a black mist seemed to gather beneath it and
//obscure the face of whoever or whatever might lie beneath.

// 13656
//“Hello again, Hermione,” whispered a sibilant voice from beneath the black hat,
//from behind the black mist.

// 13657
//Hermione’s heart was already pounding hugely inside her chest, her witch’s
//robes felt already sweat-dampened against her skin, there was a taste of fear
//already in her mouth; she didn’t know why she was so suddenly filled up with
//adrenaline but her hand gripped harder on her wand. “Who are you?” Hermione
//demanded.

// 13658
//The hat tilted slightly; the whispery voice, when it came forth from the black
//mist, sounded dry as dust. “The last ally,” spoke the sibilant whisper. “The
//one who finally answers, when no other will answer you. I am perhaps the only
//__true__ friend you have in all Hogwarts, Hermione. For you have now seen
//how the others stayed silent when you were in need -”

// 13659
//“What’s your __name?__”

// 13660
//The black cloak rotated slightly, back and forth, it didn’t __look__ like
//shoulders shrugging, but it conveyed a shrug. “That is the riddle, young
//Ravenclaw. Until you solve it, you may call me whatever you wish.”

// 13661
//She could feel her palm already sweaty and was thankful for the spiral grooves
//on her wand that helped her hand keep a steady grip on the wood. “Well, Mister
//Incredibly Suspicious Person,” Hermione said, “what do you want with me?”

// 13662
//“That is the wrong question,” came the whisper from black mist. “You should
//ask, rather, what __I__ can offer __you__.”

// 13663
//“No,” the young girl said quite steadily, “I don’t think I __should__ be
//asking that, actually.”

// 13664
//A high-pitched chuckle from behind the black mist. “Not power,” whispered the
//voice, “not wealth, you care little for such things, do you, young Ravenclaw?
//__Knowledge__. That is what I possess. I know what is unfolding within
//this school, all the hidden plans and players, the answers of the riddle. I
//know the true reason for the coldness you see in Harry Potter’s eyes. I know
//the true nature of Professor Quirrell’s mysterious illness. I know who
//Dumbledore truly fears.”

// 13665
//“Good for you,” said Hermione Granger. “But do you know how many licks it takes
//to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie Pop?”

// 13666
//The black mist seemed to darken slightly, the voice sounded lower when it
//spoke, disappointed. “So you are not even curious, young Ravenclaw, about the
//truths behind the lies?”

// 13667
//“One hundred and eighty-seven,” she said. “I tried it once and that’s how many
//it came out to.” Her hand was almost slipping on her wand, there was a sense of
//fatigue in her fingers like she’d been holding the wand for hours instead of
//minutes -

// 13668
//The voice hissed, “Professor Snape is a hidden Death Eater.”

// 13669
//Hermione almost dropped her wand.

// 13670
//“Ah,” the voice whispered in satisfaction. “I thought that might interest you.
//So, Hermione. Is there anything else you would like to know about your enemies,
//or those you call friends?”

// 13671
//She stared up at the black mist that topped the towering black cloak,
//frantically trying to order her thoughts. Professor Snape was a Death Eater?
//Who would tell __her__ something like that, __why,__ what was going
//__on?__ “That’s -” Hermione said. Her voice was quavering. “That’s
//extremely serious business, if it’s really true. Why are you telling something
//like that to __me,__ and not to Headmaster Dumbledore?”

// 13672
//“Dumbledore did nothing to stop Snape,” the black mist whispered. “You saw it,
//Hermione. The rot at Hogwarts begins at the top. Everything that is wrong with
//this school, it all begins with the mad Headmaster. You alone dared to call him
//out for it - and therefore I speak to you.”

// 13673
//“And have you also spoken to Harry Potter, then?” Hermoine said, keeping her
//voice as even as she could. If __this__ was his helpful ghost -

// 13674
//The black mist darkened and lightened, like a shake of the head. “I am
//frightened of Harry Potter,” it whispered. “Of the coldness in his eyes, of the
//darkness that grows behind them. Harry Potter is a killer, and anyone who is an
//obstacle to him will die. Even you, Hermione Granger, if you dare truly oppose
//him, the darkness behind his eyes will reach out and destroy you. This I know.”

// 13675
//“Then you don’t know half of what you pretend to know,” Hermione said, her
//voice a little firmer. “I’m scared of Harry too. But not because of what he
//might ever do to __me__. I’m scared of what he might do to
//__protect__ me -”

// 13676
//“Wrong.” The whisper was flat, and hard, as if to brook no possibility of
//denial. “Harry Potter __will__ turn against you in time, Hermione, when
//the darkness takes him fully. He will not shed a tear, he will not even notice,
//on the day his footsteps finally crush you underneath.”

// 13677
//“__Double__ wrong!” she said back in a rising voice, even though there
//were chills going down her spine. One of Harry’s phrases came to her. “Just
//what do you think you know, and how do you think you know it, anyway?”

// 13678
//“Time -” The voice seemed to catch itself. “Time enough for that later. For
//now, for today, indeed Harry Potter is not your enemy. And yet you are in
//gravest danger.”

// 13679
//“I can believe __that__,” said Hermione Granger. She desperately wanted to
//shift her wand to her other hand, she felt like she needed to grab her right
//arm just to keep it up, her head ached like she’d been staring at the black
//mist for days; she didn’t know why she’d gotten tired so quickly.

// 13680
//“Lucius Malfoy has taken notice of you, Hermione.” The whisper had risen,
//departed from its tonelessness, taken on a note of audible concern. “You have
//humiliated Slytherin House, you have defeated his son in battle. Even before
//then you were an embarrassment to all who stand with the Death Eaters; for you
//are a Muggleborn and yet you possess a power of wizardry greater than any
//pureblood. And now you are becoming known, the eyes of the world on you. Lucius
//Malfoy seeks to crush you, Hermione, to hurt you and perhaps even kill you, and
//he has the means to do it!” The whisper had grown urgent.

// 13681
//There was a pause.

// 13682
//“Is that all?” Hermione said. If she was ex-Colonel Zabini or Harry Potter,
//she’d probably be asking clever questions to gather more information; but her
//mind felt slow and fatigued. She really needed to get out of here and go lie
//down for a while.

// 13683
//“You don’t believe me,” the whisper said, softer and sadder now. “Why not,
//Hermione? I __am__ trying to help you.”

// 13684
//Hermione took a step backward, away from the shadowy alcove.

// 13685
//“__Why not, Hermione?__” demanded the voice, rising to a hiss. “You owe me
//that much! Tell me, and then -” The voice caught, and came back quieter. “And
//then you can go, I suppose. Only tell me - __why__ -”

// 13686
//Maybe she shouldn’t’ve answered; maybe she should’ve just turned and fled, or
//better yet, cast a Prismatic Wall first and then screamed at the top of her
//lungs as she ran; but it was the note of real pain in the voice that caught
//her, and so she answered.

// 13687
//“Because you look incredibly dark and scary and suspicious,” Hermione said,
//keeping her voice polite, as her wand stayed level on the towering black cloak
//and the faceless black mist.

// 13688
//“That’s __all?__” whispered the voice incredulously. Sadness seemed to
//infuse it. “I hoped for better from you, Hermione. Surely such a Ravenclaw as
//you, the most intelligent Ravenclaw to grace Hogwarts in a generation, knows
//that appearances can be misleading.”

// 13689
//“Oh, I know it,” said Hermione. She took another step back, her tired fingers
//tightening on the wand. “But the thing that people forget sometimes, is that
//even though appearances __can__ be misleading, they’re usually
//__not.__”

// 13690
//There was a pause.

// 13691
//“You __are__ the clever one,” said the voice, and the black mist
//evaporated away, no longer obscuring; she saw the face beneath, and recognition
//sent a jolt of terrified adrenaline bursting through her -

// 13692
//__(fleeting disorientation)__

// 13693
//- and then a rush of shock and fear hit her like a Stunning Hex over her whole
  //body, she found that without any thought or any conscious decision her wand
//had leaped into her hand and was already pointed at…

// 13694
//…a shining lady, her long white dress billowing about her as though in
//invisible winds; neither her hands nor her feet were visible, her face hidden
//beneath a white veil; and she was glowing all over, not like a ghost, not
//transparent, just surrounded by soft white light.

// 13695
//Hermione stared open-mouthed at the gentle sight, wondering why her heart was
//already hammering, and why she felt so scared.

// 13696
//“Hello again, Hermione,” the kindly whisper emanated from the white glow behind
//the veil. “I’ve been sent to help you, so please don’t be afraid. I am your
//servant in all things; for you, my Lady, are the bearer of a most marvelous
//destiny -”

// 13697
//…

// 13698
//…

// 13699
//…
