//______(April 8th, 1992, 7:22pm)__

// 15228
//The four of them gathered once more around the ancient desk of the Headmaster
//of Hogwarts, with its drawers within drawers within drawers, wherein all the
//past paperwork of the Hogwarts School was stored; legend had it that
//Headmistress Shehla had once gotten lost in that desk, and was, in fact, still
//there, and wouldn’t be let out again until she got her files organized. Minerva
//didn’t particularly look forward to inheriting those drawers, when she
//inherited that desk someday - if any of them survived.

// 15229
//Albus Dumbledore was seated behind his desk, looking grave and composed.

// 15230
//Severus Snape was standing next to the dead Floo and its ashes, hovering
//ominously like the vampire that students sometimes accused him of pretending to
//be.

// 15231
//Mad-Eye Moody had been meant to join them, but was yet to arrive.

// 15232
//And Harry…

// 15233
//A boy’s small, thin frame, perched on the arm of his chair, as though the
//energies running through him were too great to allow ordinary seating. Set
//face, sweaty hair, intent green eyes, and within it all, the jagged
//lightning-bolt of his never-healing scar. He seemed grimmer, now; even compared
//to a single week earlier.

// 15234
//For a moment Minerva flashed back to her trip to Diagon Alley with Harry, what
//seemed like ages and ages ago. There’d been this somber boy __inside__
//that Harry, somehow, even then. This wasn’t entirely her own fault, or Albus’s
//fault. And yet there was something almost unbearably sad about the contrast
//between the young boy she’d first met, and what magical Britain had made of
//him. Harry had never had much of an ordinary childhood, she’d gathered; Harry’s
//adoptive parents had said to her that he’d spoken little and played less with
//Muggle children. It was painful to think that Harry might have had only a few
//months of playing beside the other children in Hogwarts, before the war’s
//demands had stripped it all away. Maybe there was another face that Harry
//showed to the children his own age, when he wasn’t staring down the Wizengamot.
//But she couldn’t stop herself from imagining Harry Potter’s childhood as a heap
//of firewood, and herself and Albus feeding the wooden branches, piece by piece,
//into the flames.

// 15235
//“Prophecies are strange things,” said Albus Dumbledore. The old wizard’s eyes
//were half-lidded, as though in weariness. “Vague, unclear, meaning escaping
//like water held between loose fingers. Prophecy is ever a burden, for there are
//no answers there, only questions.”

// 15236
//Harry Potter was sitting tensely. “Headmaster Dumbledore,” said the boy with
//soft precision, “my friends are being targeted. Hermione Granger almost went to
//Azkaban. The war has begun, as you put it. Professor Trelawney’s prophecy is
//key information for weighing up the balance of my hypotheses about what’s going
//on. Not to mention how silly it is - and __dangerous__ - that the Dark
//Lord knows the prophecy and __I don’t__.”

// 15237
//Albus looked a grim question at her, and she shook her head in reply; in
//whatever unimaginable way Harry had discovered that Trelawney had made the
//prophecy and that the Dark Lord knew of it, he hadn’t learned that much from
//her.

// 15238
//“Voldemort, seeking to avert that very prophecy, went to his defeat at your
//hands,” the old wizard said then. “His knowledge brought him only harm. Ponder
//that carefully, Harry Potter.”

// 15239
//“Yes, Headmaster, I do understand that. My home culture also has a literary
//tradition of self-fulfilling and misinterpreted prophecies. I’ll interpret with
//caution, rest assured. But I’ve already guessed quite a bit. Is it safer for me
//to work from partial guesses?”

// 15240
//Time passed.

// 15241
//“Minerva,” said Albus. “If you would.”

// 15242
//“The one…” she began. The words came falteringly to her throat; she was no
//actress. She couldn’t imitate the deep, chilling tone of the original prophecy;
//and yet somehow that tone seemed to carry all the __meaning.__ “The one
//with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches… born to those who have
//thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies…”
// hedrok: #пророцтво (028:5929)

// 15243
//“__And the Dark Lord shall mark him as his equal,__” came Severus’s voice,
//making her jump within her chair. The Potions Master loomed tall by the
//fireplace. ”__But he shall have power the Dark Lord knows not… and either
//must destroy all but a remnant of the other, for those two different spirits
//cannot exist in the same world.__”

// 15244
//That last line Severus spoke with so much foreboding that it chilled her bones;
//it was almost like listening to Sybill Trelawney.

// 15245
//Harry was listening with a frown. “Can you repeat that?” said Harry.

// 15246
//“__The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches, born to
//those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month -__”

// 15247
//“Actually, hold on, can you write that down? I need to analyze this
//__carefully__ -”

// 15248
//This was done, with both Albus and Severus watching the parchment hawklike, as
//though to make sure that no unseen hand reached in and snatched the precious
//information away.

// 15249
//“Let’s see…” Harry said. “I’m male and born on July 31st, check. I did in fact
//vanquish the Dark Lord, check. Ambiguous pronoun in line two… but I wasn’t born
//yet so it’s hard to see how my parents could have thrice defied __me.__
//This scar is an obvious candidate for the mark…” Harry touched his forehead.
//“Then there’s the power the Dark Lord knows not, which probably refers to my
//scientific background -”

// 15250
//“No,” said Severus.

// 15251
//Harry looked at the Potions Master in surprise.

// 15252
//Severus’s eyes were closed, his face tightened in concentration. “The Dark Lord
//could obtain that power by studying the same books as you, Potter. But the
//prophecy did not say, __power the Dark Lord has not.__ Nor even,
//__power the Dark Lord cannot have.__ She spoke of __power the Dark
//Lord knows not__… it will be something stranger to him than Muggle artifacts.
//Something perhaps that he cannot comprehend at all, even having seen it…”

// 15253
//“Science is not a bag of technological tricks,” Harry said. “It’s not just the
//Muggle version of a wand. It’s not even knowledge like memorizing the periodic
//table. It’s a different way of __thinking.__”

// 15254
//“Perhaps…” the Potions Master murmured, but his voice was skeptical.

// 15255
//“It is hazardous,” Albus said, “to read too far into a prophecy, even if you
//have heard it yourself. They are things of exceeding frustration.”

// 15256
//“So I see,” Harry said. His hand rose up, rubbed the scar on his forehead.
//“But… okay, if __this__ is really all we know… look, I’ll just put it
//bluntly. How do you __know__ that the Dark Lord actually survived?”

// 15257
//“__What?__” she cried. Albus just sighed and leaned back in the vast
//Headmaster’s chair.

// 15258
//“Well,” Harry said, “imagine how this prophecy sounded back when it was made.
//You-Know-Who learns the prophecy, and it sounds like I’m destined to grow up
//and overthrow him. That the two of us are meant to have a final battle where
//either of us must destroy all but a remnant of the other. So You-Know-Who
//attacks Godric’s Hollow and __immediately__ gets vanquished, leaving
//behind __some__ remnant which may or may not be his disembodied soul.
//Maybe the Death Eaters are his remnant, or the Dark Mark. This prophecy could
//already be fulfilled, is what I’m saying. Don’t get me wrong - I do realize
//that my interpretation sounds stretched. Trelawney’s phrasing doesn’t seem
//natural for describing __only__ the events that historically happened on
//October 31st, 1981. Attacking a baby and having the spell bounce off, isn’t
//something you’d normally call ‘the power to vanquish’. But if you think of the
//prophecy as being about __several__ possible futures, only __one__ of
//which was actually realized on Halloween, then the prophecy could already be
//complete.”

// 15259
//“But -” Minerva blurted. “But the raid on Azkaban -”

// 15260
//“__If__ the Dark Lord survived, then sure, he’s the most likely suspect
//for the Azkaban breakout,” Harry said reasonably. “You could even say that the
//Azkaban breakout is Bayesian evidence for the Dark Lord surviving, because an
//Azkaban breakout is more likely to happen in worlds where he’s alive than
//worlds where he’s dead. But it’s not __strong__ Bayesian evidence. It’s
//not something that__ can’t possibly happen__ unless the Dark Lord is
//alive. Professor Quirrell, who __didn’t__ start from the assumption that
//You-Know-Who was still around, had no trouble thinking of his own explanation.
//To him, it was obvious that some powerful wizard might want Bellatrix Black
//because she knew a secret of the Dark Lord’s, like some of his magical
//knowledge that he’d told to only her. The priors against anyone surviving their
//body’s death are very low, even if it’s magically possible. __Most__ times
//it doesn’t happen. So if it’s __just__ the Azkaban breakout… I’d have to
//say formally that it isn’t enough Bayesian evidence. The improbability of the
//evidence assuming that the hypothesis is false, is not commensurate with the
//prior improbability of the hypothesis.”

// 15261
//“No,” Severus said flatly. “The prophecy is not yet fulfilled. I would know if
//it were.”

// 15262
//“Are you __sure__ of that?”

// 15263
//“Yes, Potter. If the prophecy had already come true, I would
//__understand__ it! I heard Trelawney’s words, I remember Trelawney’s
//voice, and if I knew the events that matched the prophecy, I would
//__recognize__ them. What has already happened… does __not__ fit.” The
//Potions Master spoke with certainty.

// 15264
//“I’m not really sure what to do with that statement,” Harry said. His hand rose
//up, absently rubbed at his forehead. “Maybe it’s just what you__ think__
//happened that doesn’t fit, and the true history is different…”

// 15265
//“Voldemort __is__ alive,” Albus said. “There are other indications.”

// 15266
//“Such as?” Harry’s reply was instant.

// 15267
//Albus paused. “There are terrible rituals by which wizards have returned from
//death,” Albus said slowly. “That much, anyone can discern within history and
//legend. And yet those books are missing, I could not find them; it was
//Voldemort who removed them, I am sure -”

// 15268
//“So you __can’t__ find any books on immortality, and that proves that
//You-Know-Who has them?”

// 15269
//“Indeed,” said Albus. “There is a certain book - I will not name it aloud -
//missing from the Restricted Section of the Hogwarts library. An ancient scroll
//which should have been at Borgin and Burkes, with only an empty place on a
//shelf to show where it was -” The old wizard stopped. “But I suppose,” the old
//wizard said, as though to himself, “you will say that even if Voldemort tried
//to make himself immortal, it does not prove that he succeeded…”

// 15270
//Harry sighed. “Proof, Headmaster? There are only ever probabilities. If there
//are known, particular books on immortality rituals which are missing, that
//increases the probability that someone attempted one. Which, in turn, raises
//the prior probability of the Dark Lord surviving his death. This I concede, and
//thank you for contributing the fact. The question is whether the prior
//probability goes up __enough.__”

// 15271
//“Surely,” Albus said quietly, “if you concede even a __chance__ that
//Voldemort survived, that is worth guarding against?”

// 15272
//Harry inclined his head. “As you say, Headmaster. Though once a probability
//drops low enough, it’s also an error to go on obsessing about it… Given that
//books on immortality are missing, and that this prophecy would sound
//__somewhat__ more natural if it refers to the Dark Lord and I having a
//future battle, I agree that the Dark Lord being alive is a probability, not
//just possibility. But other probabilities must __also__ be taken into
//account - and in the probable worlds where You-Know-Who is __not__ alive,
//someone else framed Hermione.”

// 15273
//“Foolishness,” Severus said softly. “Utter foolishness. The Dark Mark has not
//faded, nor has its master.”

// 15274
//“See, __that’s __what I mean by formally insufficient Bayesian evidence.
//Sure, it sounds all grim and foreboding and stuff, but is it __that__
//unlikely for a magical mark to stay around after the maker dies? Suppose the
//mark is certain to continue while the Dark Lord’s sentience lives on, but
//__a priori__ we’d only have guessed a twenty percent chance of the Dark
//Mark continuing to exist after the Dark Lord dies. Then the observation, ‘The
//Dark Mark has not faded’ is five times as likely to occur in worlds where the
//Dark Lord is alive as in worlds where the Dark Lord is dead. Is that really
//commensurate with the prior improbability of immortality? Let’s say the prior
//odds were a hundred-to-one against the Dark Lord surviving. If a hypothesis is
//a hundred times as likely to be false versus true, and then you see evidence
//five times more likely if the hypothesis is true versus false, you should
//update to believing the hypothesis is twenty times as likely to be false as
//true. Odds of a hundred to one, times a likelihood ratio of one to five, equals
//odds of twenty to one that the Dark Lord is dead -”

// 15275
//“__Where__ are you getting all these numbers, Potter?”

// 15276
//“That __is__ the admitted weakness of the method,” Harry said readily.
//“But what I’m __qualitatively__ getting at is why the observation, ‘The
//Dark Mark has not faded’, is not adequate support for the hypothesis, ‘The Dark
//Lord is immortal.’ The evidence isn’t as extraordinary as the claim.” Harry
//paused. “Not to mention that even if the Dark Lord is alive, he doesn’t
//__have__ to be the one who framed Hermione. As a cunning man once said,
//there could be more than one plotter and more than one plan.”

// 15277
//“Such as the Defense Professor,” Severus said with a thin smile. “I suppose I
//must agree that he is a suspect. It was the Defense Professor last year, after
//all; and the year before that, and the year before __that__.”

// 15278
//Harry’s eyes dropped back to the parchment in his lap. “Let’s move on. Are
//we__ certain__ that this Prophecy is accurate? Nobody messed with
//Professor McGonagall’s memory, maybe edited or subtracted a line?”

// 15279
//Albus paused, then spoke slowly. “There is a great spell laid over Britain,
//recording every prophecy said within our borders. Far beneath the Most Ancient
//Hall of the Wizengamot, in the Department of Mysteries, they are recorded.”

// 15280
//“The Hall of Prophecy,” Minerva whispered. She’d read about that place, said to
//be a great room of shelves filled with glowing orbs, one after another
//appearing over the years. Merlin himself had wrought it, it was said; the
//greatest wizard’s final slap to the face of Fate. Not all prophecies conduced
//to the good; and Merlin had wished for at least those spoken of in prophecy, to
//know what had been spoken __of__ them. That was the respect Merlin had
//given to their free will, that Destiny might not control them from the outside,
//unwitting. Those mentioned within a prophecy would have an glowing orb float to
//their hand, and then hear the prophet’s true voice speaking. Others who tried
//to touch an orb, it was said, would be driven mad - or possibly just have their
//heads explode, the legends were unclear on this point. Whatever Merlin’s
//original intention, the Unspeakables hadn’t let anyone enter in centuries, so
//far as she’d heard. __Works of the Ancient Wizards__ had stated that later
//Unspeakables had discovered that tipping off the subjects of prophecies could
//interfere with seers releasing whatever temporal pressures they released; and
//so the heirs of Merlin had sealed his Hall. It did occur to Minerva to wonder
//(now that she’d spent a few months around Mr. Potter) how anyone could possibly
//__know__ that; but she also knew better than to ask Albus, in case Albus
//tried to tell her. Minerva firmly believed that you only ought to worry about
//Time if you were a clock.

// 15281
//“The Hall of Prophecy,” Albus confirmed lowly. “Those who are spoken of in a
//prophecy, may listen to that prophecy there. Do you see the implication,
//Harry?”

// 15282
//Harry frowned. “Well, I could listen to it, or the Dark Lord… oh, my
//__parents__. Those who had thrice defied him. They were also mentioned in
//the prophecy, so they could hear the recording?”

// 15283
//“If James and Lily heard anything different from what Minerva reported,” Albus
//said evenly, “they did not say so to me.”

// 15284
//“You took James and Lily __there?__” Minerva said.

// 15285
//“Fawkes can go to many places,” Albus said. “Do not mention the fact.”

// 15286
//Harry was staring directly at Albus. “Can __I__ go to this Department of
//Mysteries place and hear the recorded prophecy? The original tone of voice
//might be helpful, from what I’ve heard.”

// 15287
//Light glinted from the reflection of Albus’s half-moon glasses as the old
//wizard slowly shook his head. “I think that would be unwise,” Albus said. “For
//reasons beyond the obvious. It is dangerous, that place which Merlin made; more
//dangerous to some people than others.”

// 15288
//“I see,” Harry said tonelessly, and looked back down at the parchment. “I’ll
//take the prophecy as assumed accurate for now. The next part says that the Dark
//Lord has marked me as his equal. Any ideas on what that means exactly?”

// 15289
//“Surely not,” said Albus, “that you must imitate his ways, in any wise.”

// 15290
//“I’m not __dumb,__ Headmaster. Muggles have worked out a thing or two
//about temporal paradoxes, even if it’s all theoretical to them. I won’t throw
//away my ethics just because a signal from the future claims it’s going to
//happen, because then that becomes the only reason why it happened in the first
//place. Still, what __does__ it mean?”

// 15291
//“I do not know,” said Severus.

// 15292
//“Nor I,” she said.

// 15293
//Harry took out his wand, turned it over in his hands, gazing meditatively at
//the wood. “Eleven inches, holly, with a core of phoenix feather,” Harry said.
//“And the phoenix whose tail feather is in this wand, only ever gave one other,
//which Mr… what was his name, Olive-something… made into the core of the Dark
//Lord’s wand. __And__ I’m a Parselmouth. It seemed like a lot of
//coincidence even then. And now I find out there’s a prophecy stating that I’ll
//be the Dark Lord’s equal.”

// 15294
//Severus’s eyes were thoughtful; the Headmaster’s gaze, unreadable.

// 15295
//“Could it be,” Minerva said falteringly, “that You-Know-Who - that Voldemort -
//transferred some of his own powers to Mr. Potter, the night he gave him that
//scar? Not something he intended to do, surely. Still… I don’t see how Mr.
//Potter could be his __equal,__ if he had any less magic than the Dark Lord
//himself…”

// 15296
//“Meh,” said Harry, still looking meditatively at his wand. “I’d fight the Dark
//Lord without any magic at all, if I had to. __Homo sapiens__ didn’t become
//the dominant species on this planet by having the sharpest claws or hardest
//armor - though I suppose some of that point may be lost on wizards. Still, it’s
//beneath my dignity as a human being to be scared of anything that isn’t smarter
//than I am; and from what I’ve heard, on that particular dimension the Dark Lord
//wasn’t very scary.”

// 15297
//The Potions Master spoke, his voice taking on some of his customary
//contemptuous drawl. “You imagine yourself more intelligent than the Dark Lord,
//Potter?”

// 15298
//“Yes, in fact,” said Harry, pulling back the left sleeve of his robes, and
//rolling up the shirtsleeve beneath to expose the bare elbow. “Oh, that reminds
//me! Let’s make sure nobody here has the clearly visible tattoo in the standard,
//easily checkable location which would mark them as a secret enemy spy.”

// 15299
//Albus made a quieting gesture that halted the Potions Master before he could
//say anything scathing. “Tell me, Harry,” Albus said, “how would __you__
//have crafted the Dark Mark?”

// 15300
//“Nonstandard locations,” Harry said promptly, “not easily found without
//embarrassment and fuss, though of course any security-conscious person would
//check anyway. Make it smaller, if possible. Overlay another non-magical tattoo
//to obscure the exact shape - better yet, cover it with a layer of fake skin -”

// 15301
//“Cunning indeed,” Albus said. “But tell me, suppose you could craft any
//conditions you wished into the Mark, fading it or raising it as you wished.
//What would you do then?”

// 15302
//“Make it completely invisible at all times,” Harry said in tones of stating the
//obvious. “You don’t want there to be any detectable difference between a spy
//and a non-spy.”

// 15303
//“Suppose you are more cunning still,” Albus said. “You are a master of
//trickery, a master of deception, and you employ your abilities to the fullest.”

// 15304
//“Well -” The boy stopped, frowning. “It seems unnecessarily complicated, more
//like a tactic a villain would use in a role-playing game than something you’d
//try in a real-life war. But I suppose you could put fake Dark Marks on people
//who aren’t really Death Eaters, and keep the Dark Marks on the real Death
//Eaters invisible. But then there’s the question of why people would start
//believing in the first place that the Dark Mark identified a Death Eater… I’d
//have to think about it for at least five minutes, if I were going to take the
//problem seriously.”

// 15305
//“I ask you this,” Albus said, still in that mild tone, “because I did indeed,
//in the early days of the war, perform such tests as you suggested. The Order
//survived my folly only because Alastor did not trust in the bare arms we saw. I
//had thought, afterward, that the bearers of the Mark might hide it or show it
//at their will. And yet when we hied Igor Karkaroff before the Wizengamot, that
//Mark showed clear on his arm, for all that Karkaroff wished to protest his
//innocence. What true rule may govern the Dark Mark, I do not know. Even Severus
//is still bound by his Mark not to reveal its secrets to any who do not know
//them.”

// 15306
//“Oh, well __that__ makes it __obvious__,” Harry said promptly. “Wait,
//hold on - you were a __Death Eater?__” Harry transferred his stare to
//Severus.

// 15307
//Severus returned a thin smile. “I still am, so far as they know.”

// 15308
//“Harry,” said Albus, eyes only for the boy. “What do you mean, that makes it
//obvious?”

// 15309
//“Information theory 101,” the boy said in a lecturing tone. “Observing variable
//X conveys information about variable Y, if and only if the possible values of X
//have different probabilities given different states of Y. The instant you hear
//about anything whatsoever that varies between a spy and a nonspy, you should
//immediately think of exploiting it to distinguish spies from nonspies.
//Similarly, to distinguish reality from lies, you need a process which behaves
//differently in the presence of truth and falsehood - that’s why ‘faith’ doesn’t
//work as a discriminant, while ‘make experimental predictions and test them’
//does. You say someone with the Dark Mark can’t reveal its secrets to anyone who
//doesn’t already know them. So to find out how the Dark Mark operates, write
//down every way you can imagine the Dark Mark __might__ work, then watch
//Professor Snape try to tell each of those things to a confederate - maybe one
//who doesn’t know what the experiment is about - I’ll explain binary search
//later so that you can play Twenty Questions to narrow things down - and
//whatever he __can’t__ say out loud is true. His silence would be something
//that behaves differently in the presence of true statements about the Mark,
//versus false statements, you see.”

// 15310
//Minerva’s mouth was hanging open, she realized; and she closed it abruptly.
//Even Albus looked surprised.

// 15311
//“And after that, like I said, __any__ behavioral difference between spies
//and nonspies can be used to identify spies. Once you’ve identified at least one
//magically censored secret of the Dark Mark, you can test someone for the Dark
//Mark by seeing if they can reveal that secret to somebody who doesn’t already
//know it -”

// 15312
//__“Thank you, Mr. Potter.”__

// 15313
//Everyone looked at Severus. The Potions Master was straightening, his teeth
//bared in a grimace of angry triumph. “Headmaster, I can now speak freely of the
//Mark. If we know we are caught for a Death Eater, before others who have not
//yet seen our bare arms, our Mark reveals itself whether we will it or no. But
//if they have already seen our arms bare, it does not reveal itself; nor if we
//are only being tested from suspicion. Thus the Dark Mark seems to identify
//Death Eaters - but only those already found, you perceive.”

// 15314
//“Ah…” Albus said. “Thank you, Severus.” He closed his eyes briefly. “That would
//indeed explain why Black escaped even Peter’s notice… ah, well. And Harry’s
//proposed test?”

// 15315
//The Potions Master shook his head. “The Dark Lord was no fool, despite Potter’s
//delusions. The moment such a test is suspected, the Mark ceases to bind our
//tongues. Yet I could not hint at the possibility, but only wait for another to
//deduce it.” Another thin smile. “I would award you a good many House points,
//Mr. Potter, if it would not compromise my cover. But as you can see, the Dark
//Lord was quite cunning.” His gaze grew more distant. “Oh,” Severus breathed,
//“he was __very__ cunning indeed…”

// 15316
//Harry Potter sat still for a long moment.

// 15317
//Then -

// 15318
//“No,” Harry said. The boy shook his head. “No, that can’t __actually__ be
//true. First of all, we’re talking about the kind of logic puzzle that would
//appear in chapter __one__ of a Raymond Smullyan book, nowhere
//__near__ the level of what Muggle scientists do for a living. And second,
//for all I know, it took the Dark Lord five months of thinking to invent the
//puzzle I just solved in five seconds -”

// 15319
//“Is it __that__ inconceivable to you, Potter, that anyone could be so
//intelligent as yourself?” The Potions Master’s voice held more curiosity than
//scorn.

// 15320
//“It’s called a base rate, Professor Snape. The evidence is equally compatible
//with the Dark Lord inventing that puzzle over the course of five months or over
//the course of five seconds, but in any given population there’ll be many more
//people who can do it in five months than in five seconds…” Harry pasted a hand
//against his forehead. “Darn it, how can I explain this? I suppose, from your
//perspective, the Dark Lord came up with a clever puzzle and I cleverly solved
//it and that makes us look __equal__.”

// 15321
//“I remember your first day of Potions class,” the Potions Master said dryly. “I
//think you have a ways still to go.”

// 15322
//“Peace, Severus,” Albus said. “Harry has already accomplished more than you
//know. Yet tell me, Harry - why __do__ you believe the Dark Lord is less
//than you? Surely he is a damaged soul in many ways. But cunning for cunning -
//you are not yet ready to face him, I would judge; and I know the full tally of
//your deeds.”

// 15323
//The frustrating thing about this conversation was that Harry __couldn’t
//say his actual reasons for disagreeing, __which violated several basic
//principles of cooperative discourse.

// 15324
//He couldn’t explain how Bellatrix had really been removed from Azkaban - not by
//You-Know-Who in any guise, but by the combined wits of Harry and Professor
//Quirrell.

// 15325
//Harry didn’t want to say in front of Professor McGonagall that the existence of
//brain damage implied that there were no such things as souls. Which made a
//successful immortality ritual… well, not __impossible,__ Harry certainly
//intended to forge a road to magical immortality __someday__, but it would
//be a __lot harder__ and require __much more ingenuity__ than just
//binding an already-existent soul to a lich’s phylactery. Which no intelligent
//wizard would bother doing in the first place, if they knew their souls were
//immortal.

// 15326
//And the true and honest reason Harry knew the Dark Lord couldn’t have been
//__that__ smart… well… there wasn’t any tactful way to say it, but…

// 15327
//Harry had __been__ to a convocation of the Wizengamot. He’d __seen__
//the laughable ‘security precautions’, if you could call them that, guarding the
//deepest levels of the Ministry of Magic. They didn’t even have the Thief’s
//Downfall which goblins used to wash away Polyjuice and Imperius Curses on
//people entering Gringotts. The obvious takeover route would be to Imperius the
//Minister of Magic and a few department heads, and owl a hand grenade to anyone
//too powerful to Imperius. Or owl them knockout gas, if you needed them alive
//and in a state of Living Death to take hairs for Polyjuice potions.
//Legilimency, False Memories, the Confundus Charm - it was ridiculous, the
//magical world was __supersaturated__ with ways to cheat. Harry might not
//do any of those things himself, during his own takeover of Britain, since he
//was constrained by Ethics… well, Harry __might__ do some of the lesser
//ones, since Polyjuice or a temporary Confundus or read-only Legilimency all
//sounded better than an extra day of Azkaban… but…

// 15328
//If Harry hadn’t been constrained by Ethics, it was possible he could’ve wiped
//out the eviller sections of the Wizengamot that day; all by himself, using only
//a first-year’s magical power, on account of being clever enough to figure out
//Dementors. Though Harry might not have been in such a great political position
//after that, the surviving Wizengamot members might’ve found it easy and cheap
//to disavow his actions for P.R. purposes and condemn him, even if the smarter
//ones realized it was for the greater good… but __still.__

// 15329
//If you were completely unrestrained by ethics, armed with the ancient secrets
//of Salazar Slytherin, had dozens of powerful followers including Lucius Malfoy,
//and it took you more than ten years to __fail__ to overthrow the
//government of magical Britain, it meant you were stupid.

// 15330
//“How can I put this…” Harry said. “Look, Headmaster, you’ve got ethics, there’s
//a lot of battle tactics you don’t use because you’re not evil. And you fought
//the Dark Lord, a tremendously powerful wizard who wasn’t so restrained, and you
//held him off __anyway__. If You-Know-Who had been super-smart __on
//top of that__, you’d be __dead.__ __All__ of you. You’d have died
//__instantly -__”

// 15331
//“Harry,” Professor McGonagall said. Her voice was faltering. “Harry, we almost
//__did__ all die. More than half the Order of the Phoenix died. If not for
//Albus - Albus Dumbledore, the greatest wizard in two centuries, Harry - we
//surely would have perished.”

// 15332
//Harry passed a hand across his forehead. “I’m sorry,” Harry said. “I’m not
//trying to minimize what you went through. I know that You-Know-Who was a
//completely evil, incredibly powerful Dark Wizard with dozens of powerful
//followers, and that’s… bad, yes, definitely bad. It’s just…” __All that
//isn’t on remotely the same threat scale as the enemy being smart, in which case
//they Transfigure botulinum toxin and sneak a millionth of a gram into your
//teacup. __Was there any safe way to convey that concept without citing
//specifics? Harry couldn’t think of one.

// 15333
//“Please, Harry,” said Professor McGonagall. “Please, Harry, I beg you -
//__take the Dark Lord seriously!__ He is more dangerous than -” The senior
//witch seemed to be having trouble finding words. “He is __far__ more
//dangerous than Transfiguration.”

// 15334
//Harry’s eyebrows went up before he could stop himself. A dark chuckle came from
//Severus Snape’s direction.

// 15335
//__Um,__ said the voice of Ravenclaw within him. __Um, honestly
//Professor McGonagall is right, we’re not taking this as seriously as we’d take
//a scientific problem. The difficult thing is to react __at all__ to new
//information, instead of just flushing it out the window. Right now it looks
//like we didn’t shift belief __at all__ after encountering an unexpected,
//important argument. Our dismissal of Lord Voldemort as a serious threat
//__was__ originally based on the Dark Mark being blatantly stupid. It would
//require a focused effort to de-update and suspect the whole garden-path of
//reasoning we went down based on that false assumption, and we’re __not__
//putting in that effort right now.__

// 15336
//“All right,” Harry said, just as Professor McGonagall seemed to be about to
//speak again. “All right, to take this seriously, I need to stop and think for
//five minutes.”

// 15337
//“Please do,” said Albus Dumbledore.

// 15338
//Harry closed his eyes.

// 15339
//His Ravenclaw side divided into three.

// 15340
//__Probability estimate,__ said Ravenclaw One, who was acting as moderator.
//__That the Dark Lord is alive, and as smart as we are, and hence a
//genuine threat.__

// 15341
//__Why aren’t all his enemies already dead?__ said Ravenclaw Two, who was
//prosecuting.

// 15342
//__Note,__ said Ravenclaw One, __we had already thought of that
//argument so we can’t use it to shift belief __again__ each time we
//rehearse it.__

// 15343
//__But what’s the actual flaw in the logic? __said Ravenclaw Two.
//__In worlds with a smart Lord Voldemort, everyone in the Order of the
//Phoenix died in the first five minutes of the war. The world doesn’t look like
//that, so we don’t live in that world. QED.__

// 15344
//__Is that really certain?__ asked Ravenclaw Three, who’d been appointed as
//the defender. __Maybe there was some reason Lord Voldemort __wasn’t
//__fighting all-out back then -__

// 15345
//__Like what?__ demanded Ravenclaw Two. __Furthermore, whatever your
//excuse, I demand that the probability of your hypothesis be penalized in
//accordance with its added complexity -__

// 15346
//__Let Three talk,__ said Ravenclaw One.

// 15347
//__Okay… look,__ said Ravenclaw Three. __First of all, we don’t
//__know__ that anyone can take over the Ministry just with mind control.
//Maybe magical Britain is really an oligarchy and you need enough military power
//to intimidate the family heads into submission -__

// 15348
//__Imperius them too, __interjected Ravenclaw Two.

// 15349
//__- and the oligarchs have Thief’s Downfall in the entrances to
//__their__ homes -__

// 15350
//__Complexity penalty!__ cried Ravenclaw Two. __More epicycles!__

// 15351
//- __oh, be reasonable, __said Ravenclaw Three. __We haven’t actually
  //__seen__ anyone taking over the Ministry with a couple of well-placed
//Imperius curses. We don’t __know__ that it can actually be done that
//easily.__

// 15352
//__But,__ said Ravenclaw Two, __even taking that into account… it
//really seems like there should’ve been __some__ other way. Ten years of
//failure, really? Using only conventional terrorist tactics? That’s just… not
//even __trying.

// 15353
//__Maybe Lord Voldemort did have more creative ideas,__ replied Ravenclaw
//Three, __but he didn’t want to tip his hand to __other__ countries’
//governments, didn’t want __them__ to know how vulnerable they were and
//install Thief’s Downfall in __their__ Ministries. Not until he had Britain
//as a base and enough servants to subvert __all__ the other major
//governments simultaneously.__

// 15354
//__You’re assuming he wants to conquer the whole world,__ noted Ravenclaw
//Two.

// 15355
//__Trelawney prophesized that he would be our equal,__ intoned Ravenclaw
//Three solemnly. __Therefore, he wanted to take over the world.__

// 15356
//__And if he is your equal, and you do have to fight him -__

// 15357
//For an instant, Harry’s mind tried to imagine the specter of two
//__creative__ wizards fighting an all-out-war against each other.

// 15358
//Harry had noted all the Charms and Potions in his first-year books that could
//be creatively used to kill people. He hadn’t been able to help himself.
//Literally. He’d __tried__ to stop his brain from doing it each time, but
//it was like looking at a fish and trying to stop your brain from noticing it
//was a fish. What someone could creatively do with seventh-year, or Auror-level,
//or ancient lost magic such as Lord Voldemort had possessed… didn’t bear
//thinking about. A magically-superpowered creative-genius psychopath wasn’t a
//‘threat’, it was an extinction event.

// 15359
//Then Harry shook his head, dismissing the gloomy line his reasoning had been
//going down. The question was whether there was a significant probability of
//facing anything so terrible as a Dark Rationalist in the first place.

// 15360
//__Prior odds that someone attempting an immortality ritual would actually
//have it work…__

// 15361
//Call it one to a thousand, at a generous overestimate; it was not the case that
//roughly one wizard in a thousand survived their death. Though, admittedly Harry
//didn’t have data on how many had attempted immortality rituals first.

// 15362
//__What if the Dark Lord __is__ as smart as us?__ said Ravenclaw
//Three. __You know, the way Trelawney prophesied him being our
//__equal.__ Then he would __make__ his immortality ritual work.
//____P.S., don’t forget that ‘destroy all but a remnant of the other’
//line.__

// 15363
//Requiring that level of intelligence was an additional burdensome detail; prior
//odds of a random population member being that intelligent were low…

// 15364
//But Lord Voldemort wasn’t a randomly selected wizard, he was one particular
//wizard in the population who’d come to everyone’s attention. The puzzle of the
//Mark implied a certain minimum level of intelligence, even if (hypothetically)
//the Dark Lord had taken longer to think it through. Then again, in the Muggle
//world, all of the extremely intelligent people Harry knew about from history
//had __not__ become evil dictators or terrorists. The closest thing to that
//in the Muggle world was hedge-fund managers, and none of __them__ had
//tried to take over so much as a third-world country, a point which put upper
//bounds on both their possible evil and possible goodness.

// 15365
//There were hypotheses where the Dark Lord was smart and the Order of the
//Phoenix __didn’t__ just instantly die, but those hypotheses were more
//complicated and ought to get complexity penalties. After the complexity
//penalties of the further excuses were factored in, there would be a large
//likelihood ratio from the hypotheses ‘The Dark Lord is smart’ versus ‘The Dark
//Lord was stupid’ to the observation, ‘The Dark Lord did not instantly win the
//war’. That was probably worth a 10:1 likelihood ratio in favor of the Dark Lord
//being stupid… but maybe not 100:1. You couldn’t actually say that ‘The Dark
//Lord instantly wins’ had a probability of __more__ than 99 percent,
//assuming the Dark Lord started out smart; the sum over all possible excuses
//would be more than .01.

// 15366
//And then there was the Prophecy… which might or might not have
//__originally__ included a line about how Lord Voldemort would
//__immediately__ die if he confronted the Potters. Which Albus Dumbledore
//had then edited in Professor McGonagall’s memory, in order to lure Lord
//Voldemort to his doom. If there __was__ no such line, the Prophecy did
//sound __somewhat__ more like You-Know-Who and the Boy-Who-Lived were
//destined to have some later confrontation. But in __that__ case, it was
//less likely that Dumbledore would’ve come up with a plausible-sounding excuse
//not to take Harry to the Hall of Prophecy…

// 15367
//Harry was wondering if he could even __get__ a Bayesian calculation out of
//this. Of course, the point of a subjective Bayesian calculation wasn’t that,
//after you made up a bunch of numbers, multiplying them out would give you an
//exactly right answer. The real point was that the __process__ of making up
//numbers would force you to tally all the relevant facts and weigh all the
//relative probabilities. Like realizing, as soon as you actually
//__thought__ about the probability of the Dark Mark not-fading __if__
//You-Know-Who __was__ dead, that the probability wasn’t low enough for the
//observation to count as strong evidence. One version of the process was to
//tally hypotheses and list out evidence, make up all the numbers, do the
//calculation, and then throw out the final answer and go with your brain’s gut
//feeling __after__ you’d forced it to really __weigh__ everything. The
//trouble was that the items of evidence weren’t conditionally independent, and
//there were multiple interacting background facts of interest…

// 15368
//…well, __one__ thing at least was certain.

// 15369
//If the calculation could be done at all, it was going to take a piece of paper
//and a pencil.

// 15370
//In the fireplace at one side of the Headmaster’s office, the flames suddenly
//flared up, turning from orange to bright billious green.

// 15371
//“Ah!” said Professor McGonagall into the uncomfortable non-silence. “That would
//be Mad-Eye Moody, I suppose.”

// 15372
//“Let this matter bide for now,” the Headmaster said in some relief, as he too
//turned to regard the Floo. “I believe we are about to receive some news
//regarding it, as well.”

// 15373
//__Hypothesis: Hermione Granger______

// 15374
//______(April 8th, 1992, 6:53pm)__

// 15375
//Meanwhile in the Great Hall of Hogwarts, as the students who didn’t have secret
//meetings with the Headmaster bustled about their dinner around four huge tables
//-

// 15376
//“It’s funny,” Dean Thomas said thoughtfully. “I didn’t believe the General when
//he said that what we learned would change us forever, and we’d never be able to
//return to a normal life afterward. Once we knew. Once we saw what __he__
//could see.”

// 15377
//“I know!” said Seamus Finnigan. “I thought it was just a joke too! Like, you
//know, everything else General Chaos ever said ever.”

// 15378
//“But now -” Dean said sadly. “We __can’t __go back, can we? It’d be like
//going back to a Muggle school after having been to Hogwarts. We’ve just… we’ve
//just got to stay around each other. That’s all we can do, or we’ll go crazy.”

// 15379
//Seamus Finnigan, next to him, just nodded wordlessly and ate another bite of
//veldbeest.

// 15380
//Around them, the conversation at the Gryffindor table continued. It wasn’t as
//__relentless__ as it’d been yesterday, but now and then the topic wandered
//back.

// 15381
//“Well, there must’ve been __some__ sort of love triangle,” said a
//second-year witch named Samantha Crowley (she never answered when asked if
//there was any relation). “The question is, which ways was it __going__
//before it all went wrong? Who was in love with who - and whether or not that
//person loved them back - I don’t know __how__ many possibilities there are
//-”

// 15382
//“Sixty-four,” said Sarah Varyabil, a blossoming beauty who probably should’ve
//been Sorted into Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff instead. “No, wait, that’s wrong. I
//mean, if nobody loved Malfoy and Malfoy didn’t love anyone then he wouldn’t
//really be part of the love triangle… this is going to take Arithmancy, could
//you all wait two minutes?”

// 15383
//“__I,__ for one, think it perfectly clear that Granger is Potter’s
//moirail, and that Potter was auspisticing between Malfoy and Granger.” The
//witch who’d spoken nodded with the self-satisfaction of someone who has just
//precisely nailed down a complicated issue.

// 15384
//“Those aren’t even words,” objected a young wizard. “You’re just making them up
//as you go.”

// 15385
//“Sometimes you can’t describe a thing using __real__ words.”

// 15386
//“It’s so __sad,__” said Sherice Ngaserin, who actually had tears in her
//eyes. “They were just - they were just so __obviously__ meant to be
//together!”

// 15387
//“You mean Potter and Malfoy?” said a second-year named Colleen Johnson. “I know
//- their families hated each other so much, there’s no way they __couldn’t
//__fall in love -”

// 15388
//“No, I mean all three of them,” said Sherice.

// 15389
//This produced a brief pause in the huddled conversation. Dean Thomas was
//quietly choking on his lemonade, trying not to make any sounds as it trickled
//out of his mouth and soaked into his shirt.

// 15390
//“__Wow,__” said a dark-haired witch by the name of Nancy Hua. “That’s
//really… __sophisticated__ of you, Sherice.”

// 15391
//“Look, you all, we need to keep this realistic,” said Eloise Rosen, a tall
//witch who’d been General of an army and hence spoke with an air of authority.
//“We __know__ - because she kissed him - that Granger was in love with
//Potter. So the only reason she’d try to kill Malfoy is if she knew that she was
//losing Potter to him. There’s no need to make it all sound so complicated -
//you’re all acting like this is a play instead of real life!”

// 15392
//“But even if Granger was in love, it’s still funny that she’d just
//__snap__ like that,” said Chloe, whose black robes combined with her
//night-black skin to make her look like a darkened silhouette. “I don’t know… I
//think maybe there’s more to this than just a romance novel gone wrong. I think
//maybe most people haven’t got any idea at all what’s going on.”

// 15393
//“__Yes! Thank you!__” burst out Dean Thomas. “Look - don’t you realize -
//like Harry Potter __told__ us all - if you didn’t __predict __that
//something would happen, if it took you completely by surprise, then what you
//believed about the world when you __didn’t__ see it coming, isn’t enough
//to explain…” Dean’s voice trailed off, as he saw that nobody was listening.
//“It’s __completely hopeless,__ isn’t it?”

// 15394
//“You hadn’t figured that out yet?” said Lavender Brown, who was sitting across
//the table from her two fellow former Chaotics. “How’d you ever make
//Lieutenant?”

// 15395
//“Oh, you two be quiet!” Sherice snapped at them. “It’s obvious you both want
//the three of them for yourselves!”

// 15396
//“I mean it!” Chloe said. “What if what’s __really__ going on is different
//from all the, you know, __normal__ things that all the __ordinary__
//people are talking about? What if somebody - __made__ Granger do what she
//did, just like Potter was trying to tell everyone?”

// 15397
//“I think Chloe’s right,” said a foreign-looking boy wizard who always
//introduced himself as ‘Adrian Turnipseed’, though his parents had actually
//named him Mad Drongo. “I think this whole time there’s been…” Adrian lowered
//his voice ominously, “…a __hidden hand__…” Adrian raised his voice again,
//“shaping all that’s happened. One person who’s been behind __everything,__
//from the beginning. And I don’t mean Professor Snape, either.”

// 15398
//“You don’t mean -” gasped Sarah.

// 15399
//“Yes,” Adrian said. “The __real__ one behind it all is - __Tracey
//Davis!__”

// 15400
//“That’s what I think too,” Chloe said. “After all -” She glanced around
//rapidly. “Ever since that thing with the bullies and the ceiling - even the
//trees in the forests around Hogwarts look like they’re __shaking,__ like
//they’re __afraid -__”

// 15401
//Seamus Finnigan was frowning thoughtfully. “I think I see where Harry gets his…
//__you know…__ from,” Seamus said, lowering his voice so that only Lavender
//and Dean could hear.

// 15402
//“Oh, I totally know what you mean,” Lavender said. She didn’t bother to lower
//her own voice. “It’s a wonder he didn’t crack and just start killing everyone
//__ages__ ago.”

// 15403
//“Personally,” Dean said, also in a quieter voice, “I’d say the really scary
//part is - that could’ve been __us.__”

// 15404
//“Yeah,” said Lavender. “It’s a good thing __we’re __all perfectly sane
//now.”

// 15405
//Dean and Seamus nodded solemnly.

// 15406
//__Hypothesis: G. L.__

// 15407
//______(April 8th, 1992, 8:08pm)__

// 15408
//The Floo-Fire of the Headmaster’s office blazed a bright pale-green, the fire
//concentrating in on itself into a spinning emeraldine whirlwind, and then
//flared even brighter and spit a human figure into the air -

// 15409
//There was a blur of motion as the resolving figure snapped up a wand, smoothly
//spinning with the Floo’s momentum like a ballet dance step, so that his firing
//arc covered the entire 360-degree arc of the room; and then just as abruptly,
//the figure stopped in place.

// 15410
//In the first instant that Harry saw that man, before Harry even took in the
//eye, he noticed the scars on the hands, the scars on the face, like the man had
//been burned and cut over his entire body; though only the man’s hands and face
//were visible, of all his flesh. The rest of the man’s body was hidden, encased
//not in robes, but in leather that looked more like armor than clothing; dark
//gray leather, matching the man’s mess of grayed hair.

// 15411
//The next thing that Harry’s vision comprehended was the brilliant blue eye
//occupying the right side of the man’s face.

// 15412
//One part of Harry’s mind realized that the person whom Professor McGonagall had
//named ‘Mad-Eye Moody’ was the same as the one Dumbledore had called ‘Alastor’,
//within the memory Dumbledore had shown Harry; an image from before whatever
//event had scarred every inch of the man’s body and taken a chunk out of his
//nose -

// 15413
//And another part of his mind noticed the jolt of adrenaline. Harry had drawn
//his wand in sheer reflex when the man had spun out of the Floo like that,
//there’d been something about it that felt like __ambush,__ Harry’s hand
//had already started to level his wand for a __Somnium__ before he’d
//managed to stop himself. Even now the armored man was holding his wand level,
//not pointed at any particular person but covering the whole room, and that wand
//was already in perfect line with his eyes, like a soldier sighting down a gun.
//There was danger in the man’s stance and the set of his boots, danger in the
//leather armor he wore and danger in that brilliant blue eye.

// 15414
//When the scarred man spoke, addressing the Headmaster, his voice was edged. “I
//suppose you think this room is secure?”

// 15415
//“There are only friends here,” Dumbledore said.

// 15416
//The man’s head jerked toward Harry. “That include __him?__”

// 15417
//“If Harry Potter is not our friend,” Dumbledore said gravely, “then we are all
//certainly doomed; so we may as well assume that he is.”

// 15418
//The man’s wand stayed level, not quite pointing at Harry. “Boy almost drew on
//me just then.”

// 15419
//“Er…” Harry said. He noticed that his hand was still tightly holding the wand,
//and consciously relaxed his hand and dropped it back to his side. “Sorry about
//that, you looked a bit… combat-ready.”

// 15420
//The scarred man’s wand moved slightly away from where it had almost pointed at
//Harry, though it didn’t lower, and the man let out a short bark of laughter.
//“Constant vigilance, eh, lad?” said the man.

// 15421
//“It’s not paranoia if they really are out to get you,” Harry recited the
//proverb.

// 15422
//The man turned fully toward Harry; and insofar as Harry could read any
//expression on the scarred face, the man now looked __interested__.

// 15423
//Dumbledore’s eyes had regained some of the brilliant twinkle that they’d had
//before the Azkaban breakout, a smile beneath his silver mustache as though that
//smile had never left. “Harry, this is Alastor Moody, called also Mad-Eye, who
//will command the Order of the Phoenix after me - if anything should happen to
//me, that is. Alastor, this is Harry Potter. I have every hope the two of you
//shall get along __fantastically__.”

// 15424
//“I’ve heard a good deal about you, boy,” said Mad-Eye Moody. His one dark
//natural eye stayed fixed on Harry, while the point of brilliant blue spun
//frantically, seeming to rotate all the way around within its socket. “Not all
//of it good. Heard they’re calling you the Dementor Spooker, in the Department.”

// 15425
//After some consideration, Harry decided to reply with a knowing smile.

// 15426
//“How’d you pull off that one, boy?” the man said softly. Now his blue eye was
//fixed on Harry as well. “I had a little chat with one of the Aurors who
//escorted the Dementor there from Azkaban. Beth Martin said it came straight
//from the pit, and no-one gave it any special instructions along the way. Of
//course, she could be lying.”

// 15427
//“There wasn’t any sneaky trick to that one,” Harry said. “I just did it the
//hard way. Of course, I could also be lying.”

// 15428
//Dumbledore was leaning back in his chair, chuckling in the background, like he
//was just another device in the Headmaster’s Office and that was the sound he
//made.

// 15429
//The scarred man turned back to face the Headmaster, though his wand stayed
//pointed low and in Harry’s general direction. When he spoke his voice was gruff
//and businesslike. “I have a lead on a recent host of Voldie’s. You’re certain
//his shade is in Hogwarts now?”

// 15430
//“Not __certain__ -” Dumbledore began.

// 15431
//“Say __what?__” Harry interrupted. After having nearly concluded that the
//Dark Lord didn’t exist, it was a shock to hear it being discussed that
//matter-of-factly.

// 15432
//“Voldie’s host,” Moody said shortly. “The one he possessed before he took over
//Granger.”

// 15433
//“If the tales speak true,” Dumbledore said, “there is some device of power
//which binds Voldemort’s shade to this world; and by that means he may bargain
//with a host for possession of their body, conferring on them some portion of
//his power and his pride -”

// 15434
//“So the obvious question is who’s gained too much power too quickly,” Moody
//said abruptly. “And it turns out that there’s a fellow who’s gone and banished
//the Bandon Banshee, staked an entire rogue vampire clan in Asia, tracked down
//the Wagga-Wagga Werewolf, and exterminated a pack of ghouls using a
//tea-strainer. __And__ he’s milking it for all it’s worth; there’s been
//talk of the Order of Merlin. Seems to have turned into a charmer and a
//politician, not just a powerful wizard.”

// 15435
//“Dear me,” murmured Dumbledore. “Are you certain that he is not relying on his
//own skills?”

// 15436
//“Checked his grades,” Moody said. “Record shows Gilderoy Lockhart received a
//Troll in his Defense O.W.L.S., didn’t bother with the N.E.W.T. Just the sort of
//sucker to take the deal Voldie was offering.” The blue eye whirled crazily
//within its socket. “Unless you remember Lockhart as a student, and think he had
//enough potential to do all that by himself?”

// 15437
//“No,” said Professor McGonagall. She frowned. “Not a chance, I should say.”

// 15438
//“I fear I must agree,” Dumbledore said with an undertone of pain. “Ah,
//Gilderoy, you poor fool…”

// 15439
//Moody’s grin was more like a snarl. “Three in the morning work for you, Albus?
//Lockhart should be at his home tonight.”

// 15440
//Harry listened to this with increasing alarm, wondering if even the
//__Ministry__ had any rules about magistrates needing to issue warrants -
//never mind the illegal vigilante organization Harry now seemed to have joined.
//“Excuse me,” Harry said. “What __exactly__ happens at three in the
//morning?”

// 15441
//There must have been something in Harry’s voice that gave him away, because the
//scarred man whirled on him. “You have a problem with that, boy?”

// 15442
//Harry paused, trying to figure out how to phrase this to the stranger -

// 15443
//“You want to take him down yourself?” pressed the scarred man. “Get revenge for
//your parents, eh?”

// 15444
//“No,” Harry said as politely he could. “Honestly - look, if we knew for
//__certain__ he was a willing host for You-Know-Who, that’s one thing, but
//if we’re __not__ sure and you’re heading off to kill him -”

// 15445
//“Kill?” Mad-Eye Moody snorted. “It’s what’s locked up in his head,” Moody
//tapped his forehead, “that we need from him, boy. If we’re lucky, Voldie can’t
//wipe the sucker’s memories as easy as in his living days, and Lockhart will
//remember what the horcrux looked like.”

// 15446
//Harry mentally noted down the word __horcrux__ for future research, and
//said, “I’m just worried that someone innocent - what sounds like a pretty
//decent person, if he __did__ do all that himself - might be about to get
//hurt.”

// 15447
//“Aurors hurt people,” the scarred man said shortly. “Bad people, if you’re
//lucky. Some days you won’t be lucky, and that’s all there is to it. Just
//remember, Dark Wizards hurt a lot more people than we do.”

// 15448
//Harry took a deep breath. “Can you at least __try__ not to hurt this
//person, in case he’s __not -__”

// 15449
//“What is a first-year doing in this room, Albus?” demanded the scarred man, now
//whirling to face the Headmaster. “And don’t tell me it’s for what he did when
//he was a baby.”

// 15450
//“Harry Potter is not an ordinary first-year,” the Headmaster said quietly. “He
//has already accomplished feats impossible enough to shock even me, Alastor. His
//is the only intellect in the Order which might someday match that of Voldemort
//himself, as you or I never could.”

// 15451
//The scarred man leaned over the Headmaster’s desk. “He’s a liability. Naive.
//Doesn’t know a bloody thing about what war’s like. I want him out of here and
//all his memories of the Order wiped before one of Voldie’s servants plucks them
//straight out of his mind -”

// 15452
//“I’m an Occlumens, actually.”

// 15453
//Mad-Eye Moody directed a narrow look at the Headmaster, who nodded.

// 15454
//And then the scarred man turned to face Harry, their gazes meeting.

// 15455
//The sudden fury of the Legilimency attack almost made Harry fall off his chair,
//as a blade of white-hot steel cut into the imaginary person at the forefront of
//his mind. Harry hadn’t had a chance to practice since Mr. Bester’s training,
//and Harry very nearly lost his grip on the imaginary person the
//back-of-his-mind was pretending to be, as that person’s world turned into
//searing lava and a furious probe of questions. Harry almost lost his grip on
//only __pretending__ to hallucinate, only __pretending__ to be the
//imaginary person that was screaming in shock and pain as the Legilimency tore
//apart his sanity and reshaped him to believe that he was on fire -

// 15456
//Harry managed to break eye contact, dropping his eyes to Moody’s chin.

// 15457
//“You’re out of practice, boy,” Moody said. Harry wasn’t looking at the man’s
//face, but his voice was deadly grim. “And I’ll warn you of this but once.
//Voldie isn’t like any other Legilimens in recorded history. He doesn’t need to
//look you in the eyes, and if your shields are that rusty he’d creep in so
//softly you’d never notice a thing.”

// 15458
//“Duly noted,” Harry said to the scarred chin. Harry was more shaken than he’d
//have admitted; Mr. Bester hadn’t been anywhere near that powerful, and had
//never tested Harry like __that__. Pretending to be someone hurting that
//much had… Harry couldn’t find words for describing what it felt like to contain
//an imaginary person in that much pain, but it hadn’t been __normal__. “Do
//I get any credit for being an Occlumens in the first place?”

// 15459
//“So you’re think you’re all grown up already, eh? Look me in the eyes!”

// 15460
//Harry strengthened his shields, and looked once more into the dark grey eye and
//the brilliant blue.

// 15461
//“Ever watched someone die?” asked Mad-Eye Moody.

// 15462
//“My parents,” Harry said evenly. “I recovered the memory in January when I went
//in front of a Dementor to learn the Patronus Charm. I remember You-Know-Who’s
//voice -” A chill went through Harry’s body, his wand twitching in his hand. “My
//main tactical report is that You-Know-Who could speak the Killing Curse in less
//than half a second, but you probably already knew that.”

// 15463
//There was a gasp from Professor McGonagall’s direction, and Severus’s face had
//tightened.

// 15464
//“All right,” Mad-Eye Moody said softly. A strange, thin grin twisted up the
//lips within the scarred face. “I’ll make you the same offer I’d make to any
//trainee Auror. Land one touch on me, boy - one hit, one spell - and I’ll
//concede your right to talk back to me.”

// 15465
//“Alastor!” exclaimed Professor McGonagall’s voice. “Surely that’s an
//unreasonable test! Mr. Potter, whatever his other merits, does not have a
//hundred years of fighting experience!”

// 15466
//Harry’s eyes made a lightning dart around the room, passing over the peculiar
//devices, glancing past Dumbledore and Severus and the Sorting Hat, settling
//briefly here and there. Harry couldn’t see Professor McGonagall from where he
//was, but that didn’t matter. There was only one device he’d really wanted to
//look at, and the point of all the other glances had just been to conceal which
//one.

// 15467
//“All righty,” Harry said, and hopped off his chair, ignoring Professor
//McGonagall’s inhalation and the Potions Master’s snort of disbelief.
//Dumbledore’s eyebrows had lifted, and Moody was grinning like a tiger. “Be sure
//to wake me up in forty minutes if he does get me.” Harry settled into a
//duelist’s starting stance, his wand held low. “Let’s go, then -”

// 15468
//Harry opened his eyes, his head feeling like it had been stuffed with cotton
//wool.

// 15469
//Everyone else was gone from the Headmaster’s office, the Floo-Fire dimmed; only
//Dumbledore still waited behind the desk.

// 15470
//“Hello, Harry,” the Headmaster said quietly.

// 15471
//“I didn’t even see him __move,__” Harry marvelled, muscles creaking as he
//sat up.

// 15472
//“You were standing two paces away from Alastor Moody,” said Dumbledore, “and
//you took your eye off his wand.”

// 15473
//Harry nodded, as he took the Cloak of Invisibility out of his pouch. “I mean -
//I was taking the dueling stance so that he’d think I was a standard idiot and
//underestimate me - but I have to admit, __that__ was impressive.”

// 15474
//“So you planned it all along, Harry?” Dumbledore said.

// 15475
//“Of course,” Harry said. “Note how I’m doing this as soon as I wake up, rather
//than pausing to think of it.”

// 15476
//Harry drew the hood of the Cloak over his head, and glanced back up at the wall
//clock he’d surreptitiously glanced at earlier.

// 15477
//It had then shown around twenty-three minutes after eight, and now it was five
//minutes after nine.

// 15478
//Minerva stared as the boy put himself into the dueling stance, his wand held
//low. For a second Minerva wondered if Harry might possibly - no, that was
//completely ridiculous, it was __Mad-Eye Moody__ and that was beyond
//impossible. Of course that was what she’d thought about his partial
//Transfiguration, too…

// 15479
//“Let’s go, then,” Harry said and fell over.

// 15480
//Severus gave a single chuckle. “Mr. Potter has his points, I must confess,” the
//Potions Master said. “Though I would never say it while he was awake, and if
//you repeat the words I shall deny them, for the boy’s ego is quite large enough
//already. Mr. Potter does have his points, Mad-Eye, but duelling is not among
//them.”

// 15481
//Mad-Eye’s own chuckle was lower and grimmer. “Oh, yes,” said Mad-Eye. “Only
//fools duel. Standing like that and waiting for me to attack, what __was__
//the boy thinking? Why, I ought to give him a scar, to remember this occasion -”

// 15482
//“Alastor!” barked Albus, just as she cried “Stop!”, Severus dashed forward, and
//Mad-Eye Moody deliberately leveled his wand on Harry Potter’s body.

// 15483
//“__Stupefy!__”

// 15484
//Mad-Eye’s body seemed to almost flicker as he spun on his wooden foot like
//lightning, faster than she’d ever seen anyone move without magic, the red
//Stunning Hex passing through the suddenly empty air and barely missing Severus
//to crash into the opposite wall, and by the time her eyes jerked back to Moody
//there were seventeen radiant orbs in the pattern of a __Sagitta Magica,__
//visible for only an instant before they streaked brilliance and struck
//__something __that fell to the floor with a thud -

// 15485
//“Hello again, Harry,” said Dumbledore.

// 15486
//“I cannot __believe__ that guy’s reaction time,” Harry said, brushing off
//his Cloak as he stood up from where he’d been lying invisible on the floor,
//unseen by his previous self. “I can’t believe his movement speed either. I’m
//going to have to figure out some way to zap him without speaking an incantation
//that gives it away…”

// 15487
//- and then Mad-Eye ducked hard and fast, his hands hitting flat on the floor.
  //She almost didn’t see the two tiny white threads passing through the space
//he’d been, but her eyes went to the blue spark when the threads impacted on one
//of the Headmaster’s devices, and by the time she managed to turn her eyes back,
//Mad-Eye had spun smoothly up to his feet, his wand was dancing unseeably fast
//and there was another thudding sound -

// 15488
//“Hello again, Harry.”

// 15489
//“Pardon me, Headmaster, but could you let me go down your stairs, and then come
//back up again, before I make the final jump backward? This is going to take
//longer than one hour of preparation -”

// 15490
//Minerva gaped at Mad-Eye Moody, who hadn’t lowered his wand in the slightest;
//and Severus had a look on his face that was almost like shock.

// 15491
//“Well, boy?” said Mad-Eye Moody. “What else have you got?”

// 15492
//Harry Potter’s head appeared, floating in midair as an invisible hand drew back
//the hood of his invisibility cloak.

// 15493
//“That eye,” said Harry Potter. There was a strange fierce light in the boy’s
//eyes. “That isn’t any ordinary device. It can see right through my invisibility
//cloak. You dodged my Transfigured taser as soon as I started raising it, even
//though I didn’t speak any incantations. And now that I’ve watched it again -
//you spotted all my Time-Turned selves the moment you Flooed into this room,
//didn’t you?”

// 15494
//Mad-Eye Moody was smiling, the same teeth-bared grin she’d seen him wear as
//they’d faced off against Voldemort himself. “Spend a hundred years hunting Dark
//wizards, and you see everything,” said Moody. “I once arrested a young Japanese
//who tried a similar trick. He found out the hard way that his shadow replica
//technique was no match for this eye of mine.”

// 15495
//“You see in all directions,” Harry Potter said, that strange fierce light still
//in his gaze. “No matter where that eye is pointing, it sees everything around
//you.”

// 15496
//Moody’s tiger-grin grew wider. “There’s no more of you in this room, now,”
//Mad-Eye said. “Think that’s because you’ll give up after this time, or because
//you’ll win? Any bets, boy?”

// 15497
//“It’s my final attempt because I decided to stake my last three hours on one
//shot,” said Harry Potter. “As for whether I win -”

// 15498
//There was a blur filling the whole air of the Headmaster’s office. Mad-Eye
//Moody leapt to one side with blinding speed and an instant later Harry’s head
//darted backward as he cried “__Stuporfy!__”

// 15499
//Three shimmers in the air went past Harry’s moving head, just as a red bolt
//erupted from Harry’s location, shooting past Moody as he dodged in yet another
//direction -

// 15500
//If she’d blinked, she would have missed it, the red bolt making an angled turn
//in midair and slamming into Moody’s ear.

// 15501
//Moody fell.

// 15502
//Harry Potter’s floating head dropped to the height of a first-year on their
//hands and knees, then dropped further to the ground, his face showing sudden
//exhaustion.

// 15503
//Minerva McGonagall said, “What in __Merlin’s name__ just -”

// 15504
//“So you went to Flitwick, then,” Moody said. The retired Auror was now sitting
//in a chair, drinking long draughts from a restorative in a bottle he’d taken
//off his belt.

// 15505
//Harry Potter nodded, now sitting in his own chair instead of perched on an
//armrest. “I tried the Defense Professor first, but -” The boy grimaced. “He…
//wasn’t available. Well, I’d decided it was worth risking five House points, and
//if you say a risk is worth it, you can’t complain when you have to pay up.
//Anyway, I figured that if you had an eye that saw things other people couldn’t
//see, then as Isaac Asimov pointed out in __Second Foundation__, the weapon
//to use is a brilliant light. Read enough science fiction, you know, and you’ll
//read everything at least once. Anyway, I told Professor Flitwick that I needed
//a Charm that would make a huge number of shapes, bright and flickering and
//filling the whole office, but invisible, so only your eye could see them. I had
//no idea what it would even __mean__ to cast an illusion and then make it
//invisible, but I figured if I didn’t mention that out loud, Professor Flitwick
//would just do it anyway, and he did. Turns out there was no spell like that I
//could cast myself, but Flitwick Charmed me a one-time device for it - though I
//had to persuade him that it wasn’t cheating, since nothing could
//__possibly__ be cheating against an Auror who’d lived long enough to
//retire. And then I still didn’t see how I could hit you, when you were moving
//that fast. So I asked about targeted spells, and that was when Flitwick showed
//me that hex I cast at the end, the Swerving Stunner. It’s one of Professor
//Flitwick’s own inventions - he’s a champion duellist as well as a Charms Master
//-”

// 15506
//“I know that, son.”

// 15507
//“Sorry. Anyway, the Professor says he left the duelling circuit before he got a
//chance to use that spell, since it only works as a finishing move on an
//unshielded opponent. The hex gets as close to the target as possible along its
//original trajectory, and then once it detects that the target is getting more
//distant again, the hex turns in midair and heads straight for the target. It
//can only swerve once - but the incantation sounds very close to ‘Stupefy’ and
//the hex is the same red color, so if the enemy thinks it’s a regular Stunning
//Hex and tries a normal dodge, that midair retargeting will finish them off. Oh,
//and the Professor requested that none of us talk about his special move, just
//in case he does get a chance to use it during competition someday.”

// 15508
//“But -” said Professor McGonagall. She glanced at Mad-Eye Moody, who was
//nodding his approval, and at Severus, who was keeping his face decidedly blank.
//“Mr. Potter, you just stunned __Mad-Eye Moody! __ The most famous Dark
//wizard hunter in the history of the Auror Office! That should’ve been
//impossible!”

// 15509
//Moody let out a dark chuckle. “What’s __your__ answer to that one, kid?
//I’m curious.”

// 15510
//“Well…” Harry said. “First of all, Professor McGonagall, neither of us were
//fighting seriously.”

// 15511
//__“Neither of you?”__

// 15512
//“Of course,” Harry said. “In a serious fight, Mr. Moody would’ve dropped all my
//copies immediately without waiting for them to attack. And on my side, if it
//was __actually__ necessary to take down the most famous Auror in the
//history of the office, I’d get Headmaster Dumbledore to do it for me. And
//beyond that… since that __wasn’t__ a real fight…” Harry paused. “How can I
//put this? Wizards are used to duels where people fight back and forth with
//spells for a while. But if two Muggles with guns stand in a small room and fire
//bullets at each other… then whoever hits first, wins. And if one of them is
//deliberately missing his shots, giving the other person one chance after
//another - like Mr. Moody gave me one chance after another - well, you’d have to
//be pretty pathetic to lose.”

// 15513
//“Oh, not __that__ pathetic,” Moody said with a slightly threatening grin.

// 15514
//Harry didn’t seem to notice. “You might say that Mr. Moody was testing me to
//see if I would try to __fight__ him, or try to __win.__ That is,
//whether I’d carry out the __role__ of somebody fighting - use standard
//spells I already knew, even though I didn’t expect the __consequences__ of
//that action to be victory - or if I’d search through unusual plans until I
//found something that __could__ win. Like the difference between a student
//who sits in class because that’s what students do, versus a student who cares
//enough to ask themselves what it takes to __actually__ learn a piece of
//material, and practices however necessary - you see, Professor McGonagall? When
//you look at it that way - realize that Mr. Moody was giving me chances, and
//that I shouldn’t attack in the first place unless I think I can win - then I
//don’t come out looking so well, since it actually took me three tries to get
//him. Plus, like I said, in a real fight Mr. Moody could’ve turned
//__himself__ invisible, or put up shields -”

// 15515
//“Don’t go relying too much on shields, boy,” Mad-Eye said. The leather-clad
//Auror took another sip from his restorative flask. “What you learn in your
//first year at the academy doesn’t stay true forever, not against the strongest
//Dark Wizards. Every shield ever made, there’s some curse that goes straight
//through it, if you’re not quick enough to cast the counter. And there’s one
//curse that goes through everything, and it’s a curse any Death Eater will use.”

// 15516
//Harry Potter nodded gravely. “Right, some spells are impossible to block. I’ll
//remember that, in case anyone casts the Killing Curse at me. Again.”

// 15517
//“That kind of cleverness gets people killed, boy, and don’t you forget it.”

// 15518
//A sad-sounding sigh from the Boy-Who-Lived. “I know. Sorry.”

// 15519
//“So, son. You had something to say about when Albus and I go after Lockhart?”

// 15520
//Harry opened his mouth, then paused. “I won’t tell you how to run a war,” the
//Boy-Who-Lived said eventually. “I don’t have any experience at that. All I know
//is that there are consequences. Please be advised that my own assessment is
//that Lockhart is probably innocent, so if you can avoid hurting him without too
//much risk -” The boy shrugged. “I don’t know the cost. Just please, if you can,
//be careful not to hurt him if he’s innocent.”

// 15521
//“If I can,” said Moody.

// 15522
//“And - you’re aiming to look through his mind for evidence about the Dark Lord,
//aren’t you? I don’t know what the rules are in magical Britain about admissible
//evidence - but everyone’s always guilty of breaking __some__ law or
//another, there’s just too many laws. So if it’s __not__ about the Dark
//Lord, don’t turn him in to the Ministry, just Obliviate him and go, okay?”

// 15523
//Moody frowned. “Son, nobody gains power that fast without being up to
//__something.__”

// 15524
//“Then leave it for the ordinary Aurors, if and when they find evidence the
//ordinary way. Please, Mr. Moody. Call it a quirk of my Muggle upbringing, but
//if it’s __not__ about the war I don’t want us to be the evil police who
//break into people’s houses in the middle of the night, rummage through their
//minds and send them off to Azkaban.”

// 15525
//“I don’t see the sense of it, son, but I suppose I could do you the favor.”

// 15526
//“Is there aught else, Alastor?” inquired Albus.

// 15527
//“Yes,” said Moody. “About that Defense Professor of yours -”

// 15528
//__Hypothesis: Gilderoy Lockhart: END__

// 15529
//__Hypothesis: Dumbledore______

// 15530
//______(April 9th, 1992, 5:32pm)__

// 15531
//As Professor Quirrell slowly raised up his tea, the teacup jerked in midair,
//sending the dark translucent liquid just barely slopping over the side, so that
//only three single drops crawled down the side of the teacup. Harry would have
//missed it, if he hadn’t happened to be watching closely; for Professor
//Quirrell’s hand was perfectly steady on the cup before and after.

// 15532
//If that small jerky motion advanced to a constant tremor, it would be the end
//of any non-wandless magic for the Defense Professor. Wandwork had no room for
//trembling fingers. How much that would __actually__ handicap Professor
//Quirrell, if at all, Harry couldn’t guess. The Defense Professor was certainly
//capable of wandless magic, yet still tended to use a wand for larger things -
//but for him that might only be a convenience…

// 15533
//“Insanity,” said Professor Quirrell, as he carefully sipped from his tea - he
//was looking at the teacup, not at Harry, which was unusual for him - “can be a
//signature all its own.”

// 15534
//The Defense Professor’s small office was silent, the sound-warded room quiet in
//a way the Headmaster’s office never could be. Sometimes the two of them both
//happened to finish exhaling or inhaling at the same time; and then there was an
//auditory emptiness that was almost a sound in itself.

// 15535
//“I’ll agree with that in one sense,” Harry said. “If somebody tells me that
//everyone is __staring__ at them and that their underwear is being dusted
//with thought-controlling powder, I know they’re psychotic, because that’s the
//standard signature of psychosis. But if you tell me that __anything__
//confusing points to Albus Dumbledore as a suspect, that seems… overreaching.
//Just because I can’t see a purpose doesn’t mean there __is__ no purpose.”

// 15536
//“Purposeless?” said Professor Quirrell. “Oh, but the madness of Dumbledore is
//not that he is purposeless, but that he has too many purposes. The Headmaster
//might have planned this to make Lucius Malfoy throw away his game for vengeance
//on you - or it might be a dozen other plots. Who knows what the Headmaster
//thinks he has reason to do, when he has found reason to do so many strange
//things already?”

// 15537
//Harry had politely declined tea, even knowing that Professor Quirrell would
//know what it meant. He’d considered bringing his own can of soda - but had
//decided against that as well, after realizing how easy it would be for the
//Defense Professor to teleport in a bit of potion, even if the two of them
//couldn’t touch each other with direct magic.

// 15538
//“I have seen a little now of Dumbledore,” Harry said. “Unless everything I have
//seen is a lie, I find it difficult to believe that he would plot to send any
//Hogwarts student to Azkaban. Ever.”

// 15539
//“Ah,” the Defense Professor said softly, the tiny reflection of the teacup
//gleaming in his pale eyes. “But perhaps that is another signature, Mr. Potter.
//You have not yet comprehended the perspective of a man like Dumbledore. If he
//must, in some sufficiently noble cause, sacrifice a student - why, who would he
//choose, but she who declared herself a heroine?”

// 15540
//That gave Harry some pause. It might just be hindsight bias, but that
//__did__ seem to concentrate some of that hypotheses’s probability mass
//onto framing Hermione in particular. Similarly, Professor Quirrell __had__
//predicted in advance that Dumbledore might target Draco…

// 15541
//__But if it’s you behind all of this, Professor, you might have shaped
//your plans to frame the Headmaster, and taken care to cast suspicion on him in
//advance.__

// 15542
//The concept of ‘evidence’ had something of a different meaning, when you were
//dealing with someone who had declared themselves to play the game at ‘one level
//higher than you’.

// 15543
//“I see your point, Professor,” Harry said evenly, giving no hint of his other
//thoughts. “So you think it most probable that it was the Headmaster who framed
//Hermione?”

// 15544
//“Not necessarily, Mr. Potter.” Professor Quirrell drained his teacup in one
//swallow and then set it down, the cup making a sharp rap as it descended.
//“There is also Severus Snape - though what he might think to gain from this, I
//could not guess. Thus he is not my prime suspect either.”

// 15545
//“Then who is?” Harry said, somewhat puzzled. Professor Quirrell surely wasn’t
//about to reply ‘You-Know-Who’ -

// 15546
//“The Aurors have a rule,” said Professor Quirrell. “Investigate the victim.
//Many would-be criminals imagine that if they are the apparent victims of a
//crime, they shall not be suspected. So many criminals imagine it, indeed, that
//every senior Auror has seen it a dozen times over.”

// 15547
//“You’re not seriously trying to convince me that __Hermione__ -”

// 15548
//The Defense Professor was giving Harry one of those slit-eyed __looks__
//that meant he was being stupid.

// 15549
//__Draco?__ Draco had been interrogated under Veritaserum - but Lucius
//might have had enough control to subvert Aurors to… oh.

// 15550
//“You think __Lucius Malfoy__ set up __his own son?__” Harry said.

// 15551
//“Why not?” Professor Quirrell said softly. “From Mr. Malfoy’s recorded
//testimony, Mr. Potter, I gather that you enjoyed some success in changing Mr.
//Malfoy’s political views. If Lucius Malfoy learned of that earlier… he might
//have decided that his __former__ heir had become a liability.”

// 15552
//“I don’t buy it,” Harry said flatly.

// 15553
//“You are being wantonly naive, Mr. Potter. The history books are full of family
//disputes turned murderous, for inconveniences and threats far less than those
//which Mr. Malfoy posed to his father. I suppose next you will tell me that Lord
//Malfoy of the Death Eaters is far too gentle to wish his son such harm.” A
//tinge of heavy sarcasm.

// 15554
//“Well, yes, frankly,” Harry said. “Love is real, Professor, a phenomenon with
//observable effects. Brains are real, emotions are real, and love is as much a
//part of the real world as apples and trees. If you made experimental
//predictions without taking parental love into account, you’d have a heck of a
//time explaining why my own parents didn’t abandon me at an orphanage after the
//Incident with the Science Project.”

// 15555
//The Defense Professor did not react to this at all.

// 15556
//Harry continued. “From what Draco says, Lucius prioritized him over important
//Wizengamot votes. That’s significant evidence, since there’s less expensive
//ways to fake love, if you just want to fake it. And it’s not like the prior
//probability of a parent loving their child is __low__. I suppose it’s
//possible that Lucius was just taking on the __role__ of a loving father,
//and he renounced that role after he learned Draco was consorting with
//Muggleborns. But as the saying goes, Professor, one must distinguish
//possibility from probability.”

// 15557
//“All the better the crime,” the Defense Professor said, still in that soft
//tone, “if no one would believe it of him.”

// 15558
//“And how would Lucius even Memory-Charm Hermione in the first place, without
//setting off the wards? __He’s__ not a Professor - oh, right, you think
//it’s Professor Snape.”

// 15559
//“Wrong,” said the Defense Professor. “Lucius Malfoy would trust no servant with
//that mission. But suppose some Hogwarts Professor, intelligent enough to cast a
//well-formed Memory Charm but of no great fighting ability, is visiting
//Hogsmeade. From a dark alley the black-clad form of Malfoy steps forth - he
//would go in person, for this - and speaks to her a single word.”

// 15560
//“__Imperio__.”

// 15561
//“__Legilimens,__ rather,” said Professor Quirrell. “I do not know if the
//Hogwarts wards would trigger for a returning Professor under the Imperius
//Curse. And if I do not know, Malfoy probably does not know either. But Malfoy
//is a perfect Occlumens at least; he might be able to use Legilimency. And for
//the target…perhaps Aurora Sinistra; none would question the Astronomy Professor
//moving about at night.”

// 15562
//“Or even more obviously, Professor Sprout,” said Harry. “Since she’s the last
//person anyone would suspect.”

// 15563
//The Defense Professor hesitated minutely. “Perhaps.”

// 15564
//“Actually,” Harry said then, putting a thoughtful frown on his face, “I don’t
//suppose you know offhand if any of the current Professors at Hogwarts were
//around back when Mr. Hagrid got framed in 1943?”

// 15565
//“Dumbledore taught Transfiguration, Kettleburn taught Magical Creatures, and
//Vector taught Arithmancy,” Professor Quirrell said at once. “And I believe that
//Bathsheda Babbling, now of Ancient Runes, was then a Ravenclaw prefect. But Mr.
//Potter, there is no reason to suppose that anyone besides You-Know-Who was
//involved in __that__ affair.”

// 15566
//Harry shrugged artfully. “Seemed worth asking the question, just to check.
//Anyway, Professor, I agree it’s possible that some outsider Legilimized a
//member of Hogwarts staff - and then Obliviated them afterward, there’s no way
//anyone would forget that part. But I __don’t__ think Lucius Malfoy is a
//probable candidate for the mastermind. It’s possible but not probable that all
//of Lucius’s apparent love for Draco was just a sense of duty, and that it all
//went up in a puff of smoke. It’s possible though not probable that everything
//Lucius did in front of the Wizengamot was just an act. People’s outsides do not
//always resemble their insides, like you said. But there’s one piece of evidence
//that doesn’t fit at all.”

// 15567
//“And that would be?” said the Defense Professor, his eyes half-lidded.

// 15568
//“Lucius tried to reject a hundred thousand Galleons for Hermione’s life. I saw
//how surprised the Wizengamot was, when Lucius said he was refusing it despite
//the rules of honor. The Wizengamot didn’t __expect__ that of him. Why
//__wouldn’t__ he just take the money while acting all indignant and
//pretending to grit his teeth? He wouldn’t actually care that much about
//throwing Hermione into Azkaban.”

// 15569
//There was a pause. “Perhaps the role he was playing ran away with him,” said
//Professor Quirrell. “It does happen, Mr. Potter, in the heat of the moment.”

// 15570
//“Perhaps,” Harry said. “But it’s still one more __improbability__ to be
//postulated - and by the time you have to add up that many excuses in a theory,
//it can’t be at the top of the list anymore. Anything else in particular you
//think I ought to think about, within the range of all other possibilities?”

// 15571
//There was a long silence. The Defense Professor’s eyes dropped down to look at
//the empty teacup before them, seeming unusually distant.

// 15572
//“I suppose I can think of one final suspect,” the Defense Professor said at
//last.

// 15573
//Harry nodded.

// 15574
//The Defense Professor didn’t seem to notice, but only spoke on. “Has the
//Headmaster has told you anything - even a hint - about Professor Trelawney’s
//prophecy?”

// 15575
//“__Huh?__” Harry said automatically, converting his own sudden shock into
//the best dissembling he could manage. It probably was at the wrong level to
//fool Professor Quirrell but Harry __certainly__ couldn’t take time to
//think before replying - __wait, but how on Earth would Professor Quirrell
//know about __that__ -__ “Professor Trelawney made a prophecy?”

// 15576
//“You __were__ there to hear its beginning,” Professor Quirrell said,
//frowning. “You called out to the entire school that the prophecy could not be
//about you, since you were not coming here, you were already here.”

// 15577
//__HE IS COMING. THE ONE WHO WILL TEAR APART THE VERY -__

// 15578
//And that was as far as Professor Trelawney had gotten before Dumbledore had
//grabbed her and vanished.

// 15579
//“Oh, __that__ prophecy,” Harry said. “Sorry! It went clear out of my
//mind.”

// 15580
//Harry thought he’d put too much force into the end statement, and was
//80//-expecting Professor Quirrell to say, __Aha, now Mr. Potter, what is
//this mysterious __other__ prophecy you went to such lengths to deny -__

// 15581
//“That is foolish,” the Defense Professor said sharply, “if indeed you are
//telling me the truth. Prophecies are not trivial things. I have racked my brain
//much over the little that I heard, but such a small fragment is simply too
//little.”

// 15582
//“You think the one who’s coming is the one who might’ve framed Hermione?” said
//Harry. As his mind allocated yet another hypothesis, __uncertain
//predicate referent, he-who-is-coming.__

// 15583
//“With no offense meant to Miss Granger,” the Defense Professor said with
//another frown, “her life or death does not seem that important. But someone
//__was__ to come - one who, in your interpretation, was not already there -
//and someone so significant, and unknown as a player… who knows what
//__else__ they may have done?”

// 15584
//Harry nodded, and mentally sighed because he was going to have to redo his
//Lord-Voldemort odds calculation with yet another piece of evidence in the mix.

// 15585
//Professor Quirrell spoke with eyes half-lidded, looking out like through slits.
//“More than the question of whom the prophecy spoke - who was meant to
//__hear__ it? It is said that fates are spoken to those with the power to
//cause them or avert them. Dumbledore. Myself. You. As a distant fourth, Severus
//Snape. But of those four, Dumbledore and Snape would often be in Trelawney’s
//presence. You and I are the ones who would not have spent much time around her
//before that Sunday. I think it quite likely that the prophecy was meant for one
//of __us__ - before Dumbledore took the prophetess away. __Did__ the
//Headmaster say nothing more to you?” Professor Quirrell’s voice was demanding
//now. “I thought I heard too much force in that denial, Mr. Potter.”

// 15586
//“Honestly, no,” Harry said. “It had honestly slipped clear out of my mind.”

// 15587
//“Then I am rather put out with him,” Professor Quirrell said softly. “In fact,
//I think that I am angry.”

// 15588
//Harry said nothing. He didn’t even sweat. It might’ve been a poor reason for
//confidence, but on this particular score, Harry did happen to be innocent.

// 15589
//Professor Quirrell nodded once, sharply, as though in acknowledgment. “If there
//is nothing more to say between us, Mr. Potter, you may go.”

// 15590
//“I can think of one __other__ suspect,” Harry said. “Someone you didn’t
//put on your list at all. Would you analyze him to me, Professor?”

// 15591
//There was another of those moments of silence that was almost a sound in
//itself.

// 15592
//“As for __that__ suspect,” the Defense Professor said softly, “I think you
//shall prosecute him on your own, Mr. Potter, without help from me. I have heard
//such requests before, and experience leads me to refuse. Either I will do too
//good a job of prosecuting myself, and convince you that I am guilty - or else
//you will decide that my prosecution was too half-hearted, and that I am guilty.
//I will remark only this in my defense - that I would have needed a very good
//reason indeed to jeopardize your fragile alliance with the heir to House
//Malfoy.”

// 15593
//__Hypothesis: The Defense Professor______

// 15594
//______(April 8th, 1992, 8:37pm)__

// 15595
//“…so I fear I must take my leave,” Dumbledore was saying gravely. “I promised
//Quirinus… that is to say, I promised the Defense Professor… that I would not
//make any attempt to uncover his true identity, in my own person or any other.”

// 15596
//“And why’d you make a fool promise like that, then?” snapped Mad-Eye Moody.

// 15597
//“It was an unalterable condition of his employment, or so he said.” Dumbledore
//glanced at Professor McGonagall, a wry smile briefly flitting over his face.
//“And Minerva made it clear to me that Hogwarts __required__ a competent
//Defense Professor this year, even if I had to haul Grindelwald out of
//Nurmengard and prevail on old affections to persuade him to take the position.”

// 15598
//“I did not __quite__ phrase it in that fashion -”

// 15599
//“Your expression said it for you, my dear.”

// 15600
//And so soon the four of them - Harry, Professor McGonagall, the Potions Master,
//and Alastor Moody aka ‘Mad-Eye’ - were ensconced all by themselves in the
//Headmaster’s office.

// 15601
//It was strange how the Headmaster’s office seemed… __unbalanced…__ without
//the Headmaster in it. If you didn’t have the ancient wizened master to make it
//all seem __solemn__, you were just four people trying to have a serious
//meeting while surrounded by bizarre, noisy gidgets. Clearly visible from where
//Harry had perched himself on his chair’s arm was a truncated-conical object,
//like a cone with its top snipped off, slowly spinning around a pulsating
//central light which it shaded but did not obscure; and each time the inner
//light pulsated, the assembly made a __vroop-vroop-vroop__ sound that
//sounded oddly distant, muffled like it was coming from behind four solid walls,
//even though the spinning-conical-section thingy was only a meter or two away.

// 15602
//__Vroop… vroop… vroop__…

// 15603
//And then there were the various still-breathing bodies of Harry Potter he’d
//stashed in one quiet corner, cleaning up a mess that was his own in more ways
//than one. (Only one body __wasn’t__ inside a copy of the Invisibility
//Cloak; but then it merely took a small effort of concentration for Harry to
//perceive his other selves beneath the Cloak of which he was master - an effort
//which Harry had carefully __not__ put forth earlier, to avoid getting
//advance temporal information he wanted to determine by his own decision.) The
//sad thing was that by this point, having his own body visibly lying in a corner
//didn’t seem all that crazy. It was just… Hogwarts.

// 15604
//“All right, then,” Moody said, looking rather sour about it. From within his
//leather armor, the scarred man took out a black folder. “This is a copy of what
//Amelia’s people put together. She almost certainly knows we’ve got it, but it’s
//all off the books, that clear? Anyway -”

// 15605
//And Moody told them who the Department of Magical Law Enforcement thought
//‘Quirinus Quirrell’ really was. A seemingly ordinary Hogwarts student (though
//talented enough that he’d been only narrowly beaten out for the Head Boy
//position) who’d gone vacationing in Albania after his graduation, disappeared,
//returned after 25 years, and then been caught up in the Wizarding War -

// 15606
//“It was murdering the House of Monroe that made Voldie’s name,” Moody said.
//“Until then, he was just another Dark Wizard with delusions of grandeur and
//Bellatrix Black. But after that -” Moody snorted. “Every fool in the country
//flocked to serve him. You would’ve __hoped__ the Wizengamot would turn
//serious, once they realized Voldie was willing to kill their own sacred selves.
//And that’s just what the bastards did - __hope__ that some other bastard
//would turn serious. None of the cowards wanted to step in front. It was Monroe,
//Crouch, Bones, and Longbottom. That was nearly everyone in the Ministry who’d
//dare say a word that might give Voldie offense.”

// 15607
//“That was how your House came to be ennobled, Mr. Potter,” injected the solemn
//voice of Professor McGonagall. “There is an ancient law that if anyone ends a
//Most Ancient House, whoever avenges that blood will be made Noble. To be sure,
//the House of Potter was already older than some lines called Ancient. But yours
//was titled a Noble House of Britain after the end of the war, in recognition
//that you had avenged the Most Ancient House of Monroe.”

// 15608
//“Flush of gratitude and all that,” Mad-Eye Moody said sourly. “It didn’t last,
//but at least James and Lily got a fancy title and a useless medal to take to
//their graves. But that’s leaving out eight years of complete horror after
//Monroe disappeared and Regulus Black - he was Monroe’s private source in the
//Death Eaters, we’re pretty sure - was executed by Voldie. Like a dam breaking
//and gore flooding out, drowning the whole country. Albus bloody Dumbledore
//himself had to step into Monroe’s shoes, and that was barely enough for us to
//survive.”

// 15609
//Harry listened with an odd sense of unreality. Some of it __felt__ right,
//matched up with observation - especially with the speech Professor Quirrell had
//made before Christmas - and yet…

// 15610
//This was __Professor Quirrell__ they were talking about.

// 15611
//“So that’s who the Department thinks is your Defense Professor,” Mad-Eye Moody
//finished up his account. “Now what do __you__ think, son?”

// 15612
//“Well…” Harry said slowly. __It is also possible to have a mask behind
//the mask.__ “The obvious next thought is that this ‘David Monroe’ person died in
//the war after all, and this is just someone else pretending to be David Monroe
//pretending to be Quirinus Quirrell.”

// 15613
//“That’s __obvious?__” said Professor McGonagall. “Dear Merlin…”

// 15614
//“Really, boy?” said Mad-Eye Moody, his blue eye spinning rapidly. “I’d say
//that’s a little… __paranoid.__”

// 15615
//__You don’t know Professor Quirrell,__ Harry did not say. “It’s an easy
//theory to test,” Harry said out loud. “Just check whether the Defense Professor
//remembers something about the war that the real David Monroe would’ve known.
//Though I suppose, if he’s playing the part of David Monroe __pretending__
//to be someone else, he has a good excuse to __pretend__ he’s pretending he
//doesn’t know what you’re talking about -”

// 15616
//“A __little__ paranoid,” said the scarred man, his voice rising.
//“__Not paranoid enough! CONSTANT VIGILANCE!__ Think about it, lad - what
//if the __real__ David Monroe never came back from Albania?”

// 15617
//There was a pause.

// 15618
//“I see…” Harry said.

// 15619
//“Of course you do,” Professor McGonagall said. “Don’t mind me, please. I’ll
//just sit here quietly going mad.”

// 15620
//“In this line of work, if you survive, you learn that there’s three kinds of
//Dark Wizards,” Moody said grimly; his wand wasn’t pointed at anyone, it was
//angled slightly downward, but it was in his hand. It had never left his hand
//since the moment he’d entered the room. “There’s Dark Wizards that have one
//name. There’s Dark Wizards that have two names. And there’s Dark Wizards that
//change names like you and I change clothes. I saw ‘Monroe’ go through three
//Death Eaters like he was snapping twigs. There’s not many wizards that good at
//age forty-five. Dumbledore, maybe, but not many others.”

// 15621
//“Perhaps that is true,” said the Potions Master from where he was lurking. “But
//what of it, Mad-Eye? Whatever his identity, Monroe was surely the Dark Lord’s
//enemy. I’ve heard Death Eaters curse his name even after they thought him dead.
//They feared him well.”

// 15622
//“So far as Defense Professors are concerned,” Professor McGonagall said primly,
//“I shall take it and be grateful.”

// 15623
//Moody swung around to glare at her. “Just where the devil was ‘Monroe’ all
//those years he was gone, eh? Maybe he thought he could make a name for himself
//in Britain by opposing Voldie, and vanished away when he found out he was
//wrong. Then why’d he come back __now,__ hah? What’s his __new__
//plan?”

// 15624
//“He, ah…” Harry ventured tentatively. “He __says__ he always wanted to be
//a great Defense Professor because all the best fighting wizards have taught at
//Hogwarts. And he kind of __is__ being an incredibly good Defense
//Professor, actually… I mean, if he just wanted to keep up a disguise, he could
//get away with __much__ sloppier work…”

// 15625
//Professor McGonagall was nodding firmly.

// 15626
//“Naive,” Moody said flatly. “I suppose you all haven’t wondered if your Defense
//Professor set up the whole House of Monroe to be wiped out?”

// 15627
//“__What?__” cried Professor McGonagall.

// 15628
//“Our mystery wizard hears about a missing kid from a Most Ancient House of
//Britain,” Moody said. “Steps into the shoes of ‘David Monroe’, but stays away
//from the real Monroe family. But eventually the House is bound to notice
//something wrong. So this imposter somehow prods Voldie into wiping them all out
//- maybe leaked a password they’d given him for their wards - and then he was a
//Lord of the Wizengamot!”

// 15629
//There seemed to be a fight going on inside Harry’s mind between Hufflepuff One,
//who’d never trusted the Defense Professor in the first place; and Hufflepuff
//Two, who was far too loyal to Harry’s friend, Professor Quirrell, to believe
//something like that just because Moody said so.

// 15630
//__It __is__ kind of obvious, though,__ observed his Slytherin part.
//__I mean, do you actually believe that under natural circumstances,
//anyone would end up as the last heir to a Most Ancient House AND Lord Voldemort
//killed his family AND he has to avenge his martial arts sensei? If anything I’d
//say he went too far over the top in setting up his new identity as the ideal
//literary hero. That sort of thing doesn’t happen in real life. __

// 15631
//__This from an orphan who was raised unaware of his heritage,__ commented
//Harry’s Inner Critic. __With a prophecy about him. You know, I don’t
//think we’ve ever read a story about two equally destined heroes competing to
//see who’s cliched enough to take down the villain -__

// 15632
//__Yes,__ replied the central Harry over the distant vroop-ing noise in the
//background, __it’s a very sad life we lead and YOU’RE NOT HELPING.__

// 15633
//__There’s only one thing to do at this point,__ said Ravenclaw.
//__And we all know what it is, so why argue?__

// 15634
//__But,__ Harry replied, __how __do__ we test experimentally
//whether or not Professor Quirrell is the original David Monroe? I mean, what
//sort of observable behaves differently, depending on whether he’s the real
//David Monroe or an impostor?__

// 15635
//“What do you want me to do about it, Mad-Eye?” Professor McGonagall was
//demanding. “I can’t -”

// 15636
//“You can,” the scarred man said, glaring at her fiercely. “Just fire the bloody
//Defense Professor.”

// 15637
//“You say that __every__ year,” said Professor McGonagall.

// 15638
//“Yes, and I’m always right!”

// 15639
//“Constant vigilance or no, Alastor, the students must be taught!”

// 15640
//Moody snorted. “Pfah! I swear the curse gets worse every year, as you lot get
//more and more reluctant to let them go. Your precious Professor Quirrell would
//have to __be__ Grindelwald in disguise, to get himself sent off!”

// 15641
//“Is he?” Harry couldn’t help asking. “I mean, could he __actually __be -”

// 15642
//“I check Grindie’s cell every two months,” Moody said. “He was there in March.”

// 15643
//“Could the person in the cell be a ringer?”

// 15644
//“I administer a blood test for his identity, son.”

// 15645
//“Where do you keep the blood you use as a reference?”

// 15646
//“In a safe place.” Something like a smile was stretching the scarred lips.
//“Have you considered the Auror Office after you graduate?”

// 15647
//“Alastor,” Professor McGonagall said reluctantly. “The Defense Professor
//__does__ have a… health condition. I suppose you will call it suspicious
//in itself - but it is by no means certain that it will be any ill-doing on his
//part which prevents us from renewing his employment.”

// 15648
//“Yes, his little naptimes,” Moody said darkly. “Amelia thinks he stepped into
//the path of a high-level curse. Sounds to __me__ more like a Dark ritual
//gone wrong!”

// 15649
//“You’ve no proof of that!” Professor McGonagall said.

// 15650
//“That man might as well be wearing a sign saying ‘Dark Wizard’ in glowing green
//letters over his head.”

// 15651
//“Ah…” Harry said. It didn’t seem like an especially good time to ask what Mr.
//Moody thought of the ‘not all sacrificial rituals are evil’ standpoint. “Excuse
//me, but you said earlier that Professor Quirrell - I mean the old David Monroe
//- I mean the Monroe from the seventies - anyway, you said that person used the
//Killing Curse. What does that imply? Does somebody have to be a Dark Wizard to
//use it?”

// 15652
//Moody shook his head. “I’ve used it myself. All it takes is power and a certain
//__mood.__” The grimacing lips were showing teeth. “The first time I cast
//it was against a wizard named Gerald Grice, and you can ask me what __he__
//did after you graduate Hogwarts.”

// 15653
//“But why is it Unforgiveable, then?” Harry said. “I mean, a Cutting Hex can
//kill someone too. So why’s it any better to use a Reducto instead of Avada
//Kedav-”

// 15654
//“Shut your mouth!” Moody said sharply. “Someone might take it the wrong way,
//your saying that incantation. You __look__ too young to cast it, but
//there’s such a thing as Polyjuice. And to answer your question, boy, there’s
//two reasons why that spell’s in the blackest book. The first is that the
//Killing Curse strikes directly at the soul, and it’ll just keep going until it
//hits one. Straight through shields. Straight through __walls.__ There’s a
//__reason__ why even Aurors fighting Death Eaters weren’t allowed to use it
//before the Monroe Act.”

// 15655
//“Ah,” said Harry. “That does seem like an excellent reason to ban -”

// 15656
//“I’m not finished, son. The second reason is that the Killing Curse doesn’t
//__just__ take a powerful bit of magic. You’ve got to __mean__ it.
//You’ve got to __want__ someone dead, and not for the greater good, either.
//Killing Grice didn’t bring back Blair Roche, or Nathan Rehfuss, or David
//Capito. It wasn’t for justice, or to stop him doing it again. __I wanted
//him dead.__ You understand now, lad? You don’t have to be a Dark Wizard to use
//that spell - but you can’t be Albus Dumbledore, either. And if you’re arrested
//for killing with it, there’s no possible defense.”

// 15657
//“I… see,” murmured the Boy-Who-Lived. __You can’t want the person dead as
//an instrumental value on the way to some positive future consequence, you can’t
//cast it if you believe it’s a necessary evil, you have to actually want them
//dead for the sake of being dead, as a terminal value in your utility function.__
//“A magically embodied preference for death over life, striking within the plane
//of pure life force… that does sound like a difficult spell to block.”

// 15658
//“Not difficult,” Moody snapped. “__Impossible__.”

// 15659
//Harry nodded gravely. “But David Monroe - or whoever - used the Killing Curse
//against a couple of Death Eaters even __before__ they wiped out his
//family. Does that mean he already had to hate them? Like, the martial arts
//story was probably true?”

// 15660
//Moody shook his head slightly. “One of the dark truths of the Killing Curse,
//son, is that once you’ve cast it the first time, it doesn’t take much hate to
//do it again.”

// 15661
//“It damages the mind?”

// 15662
//Again Moody shook his head. “No. It’s the killing that does that. Murder tears
//the soul - but that’s just the same if it’s a Cutting Hex. The Killing Curse
//doesn’t crack your soul. It just takes a cracked soul to cast.” If there was a
//sad expression on the scarred face, it could not be read. “But that doesn’t
//tell us much about Monroe. The ones like Dumbledore who’ll never be able to
//cast the Curse all their lives, because they never crack no matter what -
//they’re the rare ones, very rare. It only takes a little cracking.”

// 15663
//There was a strange heavy feeling in Harry’s chest. He’d wondered what exactly
//it had meant, that Lily Potter had tried to cast the Killing Curse at Lord
//Voldemort with her last breath. But surely it was forgiveable, it was
//__right __and__ proper__ for a mother to hate the Dark Wizard who was
//coming to kill her baby, mocking her for how she couldn’t stop him. There was
//something wrong with you as a parent if you __couldn’t__ cast Avada
//Kedavra, in that situation. And no other spell could’ve gone past the Dark
//Lord’s shields; you’d have to at least __try__ to hate the Dark Lord
//enough to want him dead for the sake of dead, if that was the only way to save
//your baby.

// 15664
//__It only takes a little cracking…__

// 15665
//“Enough,” said Professor McGonagall. “What would you have us do?”

// 15666
//Moody’s smile twisted. “Get rid of the Defense Professor and see if all your
//troubles mysteriously clear up. Bet you a Galleon they do.”

// 15667
//Professor McGonagall looked like she was in pain. “Alastor - but - will
//__you__ teach the classes, if -”

// 15668
//“Ha!” said Moody. “If I ever say yes to that question, check me for Polyjuice,
//because it’s not me.”

// 15669
//“I’ll test it experimentally,” Harry said. And then, as everyone looked at him,
//“I’ll ask Professor Quirrell a question that the real David Monroe would know -
//like who else was in the Slytherin class of 1945, or something like that -
//hopefully without making it obvious. It won’t be definitive proof, he could’ve
//studied the role, but it would be evidence. Still, Mr. Moody, even if Professor
//Quirrell isn’t the original Monroe, I’m not sure that getting rid of him is a
//free action. He saved my life twice -”

// 15670
//“__What?__” demanded Moody. “When? How?”

// 15671
//“Once when he knocked down a bunch of witches who were summoning me toward the
//ground, once when he figured out that the Dementor was draining me through my
//wand. And if Professor Quirrell __wasn’t__ the one who set up Draco Malfoy
//in the first place, then he saved Draco Malfoy’s life, and things would be a
//lot worse if he hadn’t. If the Defense Professor __isn’t__ behind it all -
//he’s not someone we can afford to just get rid of.”

// 15672
//Professor McGonagall nodded firmly.

// 15673
//__Hypothesis: Severus Snape__________

// 15674
//______(April 8th, 1992, 9:03pm)__

// 15675
//Harry and Professor McGonagall now stood on the slowly turning stairs, turning
//without descending; or at least __one__ Harry stood upon those stairs -
//his other three selves had been left behind in the Headmaster’s office.

// 15676
//“Can I ask you a private question?” Harry said, when he thought they were far
//enough away not to be heard. “And in particular, private from the Headmaster.”

// 15677
//“Yes,” Professor McGonagall said, not quite sighing. “Though I hope you realize
//that I cannot __do__ anything which conflicts with my duties to -”

// 15678
//“Yes,” Harry said, “that’s exactly what I need to ask you about. In front of
//the Wizengamot, when Lucius Malfoy was saying that Hermione was no part of
//House Potter and that he wouldn’t take the money, you told Hermione how to
//swear that oath. I want to know, if something like that comes up again, if your
//first duty is to the Hogwarts student Hermione Granger, or to the head of the
//Order of the Phoenix, Albus Dumbledore.”

// 15679
//Professor McGonagall looked like someone had hit her in the face with a
//cast-iron frying-pan, a few minutes earlier, and now she’d been told that
//somebody was about to do it again, and not to flinch.

// 15680
//Harry flinched a little himself. Somewhere along the line he needed to pick up
//the knack of __not__ phrasing things to hit as hard as he possibly could.

// 15681
//The walls rotated around them, behind them, and somehow, they descended.

// 15682
//“Oh, Mr. Potter,” Professor McGonagall said with a low exhalation. “I…
//__wish__ you wouldn’t ask me such questions… oh, Harry, I wasn’t thinking
//then, not at all. I only saw a chance to help Miss Granger and… I __was__
//Sorted into Gryffindor, after all.”

// 15683
//“You’ve got a chance to think now,” Harry said. It was all coming out wrong,
//but he had to say it __anyway,__ because - “I’m not asking you to be loyal
//to __me.__ But if you do know - if you __are__ sure - what you’ll do
//if it comes down to an innocent Hogwarts student versus the Order of the
//Phoenix a second time…”

// 15684
//But Professor McGonagall shook her head. “I’m __not__ sure,” the
//Transfiguration Professor whispered. “I don’t know if it was the right choice
//even then. I’m sorry. I can’t decide such awful things!”

// 15685
//“But you’ll do __something__ if it happens again,” Harry said. “Indecision
//is also a choice. You can’t just __imagine__ having to make an immediate
//decision?”

// 15686
//“No,” Professor McGonagall said, sounding a little stronger; and Harry realized
//that he’d accidentally offered a way out. The Professor’s next words confirmed
//Harry’s fears. “Such a dreadful choice as that, Mr. Potter - I think I should
//not make it until I must.”

// 15687
//Harry gave an internal sigh. He supposed he had no right to expect Professor
//McGonagall to say anything else. In a moral dilemma where you lost something
//either way, making the choice would __feel__ bad either way, so you could
//temporarily save yourself a little mental pain by refusing to decide. At the
//cost of not being able to plan anything in advance, and at the cost of
//incurring a huge bias toward inaction or waiting until too late… but you
//couldn’t expect a witch to know all that. “All right,” Harry said.

// 15688
//Though it wasn’t right at all, not really. Dumbledore might want that debt
//removed, Professor Quirrell would also want Harry out of that debt. And if the
//Defense Professor __was__ David Monroe, or could convincingly
//__appear__ to be David Monroe, then Lord Voldemort technically hadn’t
//__exterminated__ the House of Monroe. In which case somebody might be able
//to pass a Wizengamot resolution revoking the Noble status of House Potter,
//which had been granted for avenging the Most Ancient House of Monroe.

// 15689
//In which case Hermione’s vow of service to a Noble House might be null and
//void.

// 15690
//Or maybe not. Harry didn’t know anything about the legalities, especially not
//whether House Potter got the money __back__ if someone managed to send
//Hermione to Azkaban. Just because you lost something might not mean the payment
//was returned, legally speaking. Harry wasn’t sure and he didn’t dare ask a
//magical solicitor…

// 15691
//…it would have been nice to be able to trust at least one adult to take
//Hermione’s side instead of Dumbledore’s, if an issue like that threatened to
//come up.

// 15692
//The stairs they were upon ceased rotating, and they were before the backs of
//the great stone gargoyles, which rumbled aside, revealing the hallway.

// 15693
//Harry stepped out -

// 15694
//A hand caught at Harry’s shoulder.

// 15695
//“Mr. Potter,” Professor McGonagall said in a low voice, “why did you to tell me
//to keep watch over Professor Snape?”

// 15696
//Harry turned around again.

// 15697
//“You told me to keep watch, and see if he’d changed,” Professor McGonagall went
//on, her tone urgent. “__Why__ did you say that, Mr. Potter?”

// 15698
//It took a moment, at this point, for Harry to think back and remember why he
//__had__ said that. Harry and Neville had rescued Lesath Lestrange from
//bullies, and then Harry had confronted Severus in the hallway and, at least
//according to the Potions Master’s own words, ‘almost died’ -

// 15699
//“I learned something that made me worry,” Harry said after a moment. “From
//someone who made me promise not to tell anyone else.” Severus had made Harry
//swear that their conversations wouldn’t be shared with anyone, and Harry was
//still bound by it.

// 15700
//“__Mr.__ Potter -” began Professor McGonagall, and then exhaled, the flash
//of sharpness disappearing as quickly as it had come. “Never mind. If you cannot
//say, you cannot say.”

// 15701
//“Why do __you__ ask?” Harry said.

// 15702
//Professor McGonagall seemed to hesitate -

// 15703
//“All right, let me be more specific,” Harry said. After Professor Quirrell had
//done it to __him__ several times, Harry was starting to get the hang of
//it. “What change have you __already__ observed in Professor Snape that
//you’re trying to decide whether to tell me about?”

// 15704
//“Harry -” the Transfiguration Professor said, and then closed her mouth.

// 15705
//“I obviously know __something__ you don’t,” Harry said helpfully. “See,
//this is why we can’t always put off trying to decide our awful moral dilemmas.”

// 15706
//Professor McGonagall closed her eyes, drew in a deep breath, pinched the bridge
//of her nose and squeezed it several times. “All right,” she said. “It’s a
//subtle thing… but worrying. How can I put this… Mr. Potter, have you read many
//books that young children are not meant to read?”

// 15707
//“I’ve read __all__ of them.”

// 15708
//“Of course you have. Well… I don’t quite understand it myself, but for so long
//as Severus has been employed in this school, stalking about in that awful
//stained cloak, there has been a __certain sort of girl __that stares at
//him with longing eyes -”

// 15709
//“You say that like it’s a bad thing?” Harry said. “I mean, if there’s one thing
//I __did__ understand from those books, it’s that you’re not supposed to
//question people’s preferences.”

// 15710
//Professor McGonagall gave Harry a __very__ strange look.

// 15711
//“I mean,” Harry said again, “from what I’ve read, when I’m a bit older there’s
//something like a 10// chance that __I’ll__ find Professor Snape attractive,
//and the important thing is for me to just accept whatever I -”

// 15712
//“__In any case, Mr. Potter, __Severus has always been entirely indifferent
//to the stares of those young girls. But now -” Professor McGonagall seemed to
//realize something, and hastily said, her hands rising in warding, “Please don’t
//mistake me, Professor Snape __certainly__ has not taken advantage of any
//young witches! Absolutely not! He has never even so much as smiled at one, not
//that I ever heard. He has told the young girls to stop gaping at him. And if
//they stare at him regardless, he looks away. That I have seen with my own
//eyes.”

// 15713
//“Er…” Harry said. “Sorry, but just because I’ve __read__ those books
//doesn’t mean I understood them. What does all that __mean?__”

// 15714
//“That he is __noticing__,” Professor McGonagall said in a low voice. “It
//is a subtle thing, but now that I have seen it, I am certain. And __that__
//means… I am very much afraid… that the bond which held Severus to Albus’s
//cause… may have weakened, or even broken.”

// 15715
//2 + 2 = …

// 15716
//__“Snape and Dumbledore?__” Then Harry heard the words that had just come
//out of his mouth, and hastily added, “Not that there’s anything wrong with that
//-”

// 15717
//__“No!”__ said Professor McGonagall. “Oh, for pity’s sake - I can’t
//explain it to you, Mr. Potter!”

// 15718
//The other shoe finally dropped.

// 15719
//__He was __still__ in love with my mother?__

// 15720
//This seemed somewhere between beautifully sad, and pathetic, for around five
//seconds before the __third__ shoe dropped.

// 15721
//__Of course, that was before I gave him my helpful relationship advice.__

// 15722
//“I see,” Harry said carefully after a few moments. There were times when saying
//‘Oops’ didn’t fully cover it. “You’re right, that’s not a good sign.”

// 15723
//Professor McGonagall put both hands over her face. “Whatever you’re thinking
//right now,” she said in a slightly muffled voice, “which I assure you is
//__also__ wrong, I don’t want to hear about it, ever.”

// 15724
//“So…” Harry said. “If, like you said, the bond that held Professor Snape to the
//Headmaster __has__ broken… what would he do then?”

// 15725
//There was a long silence.

// 15726
//__What would he do then?__

// 15727
//Minerva lowered her hands, gazing down at the upturned face of the
//Boy-Who-Lived. One simple question shouldn’t have caused her so much dismay.
//She’d known Severus for years; the two of them bound, in some strange way, by
//the prophecy they’d both heard. Though Minerva suspected, from what she knew of
//the rules of prophecy, that she had only __overheard__ it herself. It had
//been Severus’s acts which had brought about the prophecy’s fulfillment. And the
//guilt, the heartbreak which had come of that choice, had been tormenting the
//Potions Master for years. She couldn’t imagine who Severus would be without it.
//Her mind went blank, trying to imagine; her thoughts an empty parchment.

// 15728
//__Surely__ Severus was no longer the man he’d once been, that angry and
//terribly foolish young man who’d brought the prophecy before Voldemort in
//exchange for being admitted into the Death Eaters. She’d known him for years,
//and surely Severus was no longer that man…

// 15729
//Did she really know him at all?

// 15730
//Had __anyone__ ever seen the real Severus Snape?

// 15731
//“I don’t know,” Professor McGonagall finally said. “I truly don’t know at all.
//I can’t even imagine. Do __you__ know anything of this, Mr. Potter?”

// 15732
//“Er…” Harry said. “I think I can say that my own evidence points in the same
//direction as yours. I mean, it increases the probability that Professor Snape
//isn’t in love with my mother anymore.”

// 15733
//Professor McGonagall closed her eyes. “I give up.”

// 15734
//“I don’t know of anything wrong he’s done apart from that, though,” Harry
//added. “I assume the Headmaster cleared you to ask me about this?”

// 15735
//Professor McGonagall looked away from him, staring at the wall. “Please don’t,
//Harry.”

// 15736
//“All right,” Harry said, and turned and hurried out into the hallways, hearing
//Professor McGonagall more slowly walking after, and the rumbling sound of the
//gargoyles moving into place.

// 15737
//It was the morning after next, during Potions class, that Harry’s
//__potion of cold resistance__ boiled over his cauldron with a green froth
//and mildly nauseating smell, and Professor Snape, looking more resigned than
//disgusted, told Harry to stay after class. Harry had his own suspicions about
//this affair, and as soon as class let out - Hermione, as usual for the last few
//days, being the first to flee out the door - the door swung shut and locked
//behind the departing students.

// 15738
//“I apologize for ruining your potion, Mr. Potter,” Severus Snape said quietly.
//There was upon his face the strange sad look that Harry had seen only once
//before, in a hallway some time ago. “It will not be reflected in your grades.
//Please, sit down.”

// 15739
//Harry sat back down at his desk, filling up the time by scrubbing a bit more at
//the green stain on the wooden surface, as the Potions Master incanted a few
//privacy spells.

// 15740
//When the Potions Master was done, he spoke again. “I… do not know how to broach
//this topic, Mr. Potter, so I will simply say it… before the Dementor, you
//recovered your memory of the night your parents died?”

// 15741
//Harry silently nodded.

// 15742
//“If… I know it must not be a pleasant memory, but… if you could tell me what
//happened…?”

// 15743
//“Why?” Harry said. His voice was solemn, definitely __not mocking__ the
//pleading look that Harry had never expected to see from that person. “I
//wouldn’t think that would be a pleasant thing for you to hear either, Professor
//-”

// 15744
//The Potions Master’s voice was almost a whisper. “I have imagined it every
//night these last ten years.”

// 15745
//__You know,__ said Harry’s Slytherin side, __it might not be such a
//good idea to give him closure, if his guilt-based loyalties are already
//wavering -__

// 15746
//__Shut up. Overruled.__

// 15747
//It wasn’t something that Harry could __actually__ bring himself to deny.
//He took one suggestion from his Slytherin side, and that was it.

// 15748
//“Will you tell me __exactly__ how you came to learn about the Prophecy?”
//Harry said. “I’m sorry to make this a trade, I __will__ tell you
//afterward, only, it could be really important -”

// 15749
//“There is little to say. I had come to be interviewed by the Deputy
//Headmistress for the position of Potions Master, and so I was waiting outside
//the room of the Hog’s Head Inn when the applicant before me, Sybill Trelawney,
//came to seek the position of Professor of Divination. As soon as Trelawney
//finished speaking her words, I fled, forsaking my chance at Hogwarts’s Mastery,
//and went to the Dark Lord.” The Potions Master’s face was drawn and tight. “I
//did not even pause to consider why that riddle might have come to me, before I
//sold it to another.”

// 15750
//“A __job interview?__” Harry said. “Where you and Professor Trelawney both
//happened to be applying, and Professor McGonagall was interviewing? That seems…
//like rather a large coincidence…”

// 15751
//“Seers are the pawns of time, Mr. Potter. Coincidence is beneath them, and they
//are above it. I was the one meant to hear that prophecy and become its fool.
//Minerva’s presence made no final difference to how it came about. There was no
//Memory Charm as you supposed, I do not know why you thought that, but there was
//no Memory-Charm, there could have been no Memory-Charm. The voice of a seer has
//a quality, an enigma which even Legilimency cannot share, how could that be
//imbued in a false memory? Do you think the Dark Lord would believe my mere
//words? The Dark Lord seized my mind and saw the mystification there, even if he
//could not seize the mystery, and so he knew the prophecy had been true. The
//Dark Lord could have killed me then, having taken what he wanted - I was a fool
//indeed to go to him - but he saw something in me I do not know, and took me
//into the Death Eaters, though on his terms rather than mine. That is how I
//brought it about, brought it all about, from beginning to end, always my own
//doing.” Severus’s voice had gone rather hoarse, and his face was filled with
//naked pain. “Now tell me, please, how did Lily die?”

// 15752
//Harry swallowed twice, and began his recounting.

// 15753
//“James Potter shouted for Lily to run away with me, that he would hold off
//You-Know-Who.”

// 15754
//“You-Know-Who said -” Harry stopped, the chills going all over his own skin,
//his own muscles tightening as if in preparing for a seizure. The memory was
//returning strongly, now, accompanied by cold and darkness in association. “He
//used… the Killing Curse… and then he came upstairs somehow, I think he must
//have flown, I don’t remember any footsteps on stairs or anything like that… and
//then my mother said, ‘No, not Harry, please not Harry!’ or something like that.
//And the Dark Lord - his voice was so high, like water whistling out of a
//teakettle only __cold__ - the Dark Lord said -”

// 15755
//__Stand aside, woman! For you I am not come, only the boy.__

// 15756
//The words were very clear in Harry’s memory.

// 15757
//“- he told my mother to get out of his way, that he was only there for
//__me__, and my mother begged him to have mercy, and the Dark Lord said -”

// 15758
//__I give you this rare chance to flee.__

// 15759
//“- that he was being generous and giving her a chance to run, but he wouldn’t
//bother fighting her, and even if she died, she couldn’t save me -” Harry’s
//voice was unsteady, “- and so she ought to get out of his way. And that was
//when my mother begged the Dark Lord to take her life instead of mine - and the
//Dark Lord - the Dark Lord said to her - and his voice was lower this time, like
//he was dropping a pose -”

// 15760
//__Very well, I accept the bargain.__

// 15761
//“- he said that he accepted her offer, and that she should drop her wand so he
//could kill her. And then the Dark Lord waited, just waited. I, I don’t know
//what Lily Potter was thinking, it hadn’t even made sense in the first place,
//what she said, it wasn’t like the Dark Lord would kill her and then just
//__leave, __when he’d come there for me. Lily Potter didn’t say anything,
//and then the Dark Lord started laughing at her and it was horrible and - and
//she finally tried the only thing left that wasn’t abandoning me or just giving
//up and dying. I don’t know if she even could’ve, if the spell would’ve worked
//for her, but when you think about, she had to try. The last thing my mother
//said was ‘Avada Ke-’ but the Dark Lord started his own curse as soon as she
//said ‘Av’ and he said it in less than half a second and there was a flash of
//green light and then - and then - __and then__ -”

// 15762
//“That’s enough.”

// 15763
//Slowly, like a body floating to the surface of water, Harry returned from
//wherever he’d been.

// 15764
//“That’s enough,” the Potions Master said hoarsely. “She died… Lily died without
//pain, then? The Dark Lord… did not do anything to her, before she died?”

// 15765
//__She died thinking that she’d failed, and that the Dark Lord was going
//to kill her baby next. That’s pain.__

// 15766
//“He - the Dark Lord didn’t torture her -” Harry said. “If that’s what you’re
//asking.”

// 15767
//Behind Harry, the door unlocked itself and swung open.

// 15768
//Harry left.

// 15769
//It was Friday, April 10th, of 1992.
