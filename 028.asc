//== Reductionism

// 5665
//Whatever can go Rowling will go Rowling.

// 5666
//This should __again__ go __without saying,__ but views expressed by
//Severus Snape are not necessarily those of the author.

// 5667
//“Okay,” Harry said, swallowing. “Okay, Hermione, it’s enough, you can stop.”

// 5668
//The white sugar pill in front of Hermione still hadn’t changed shape or color
//at all, even though she was concentrating harder than Harry had ever seen, her
//eyes squeezed shut, beads of sweat on her forehead, hand trembling as it
//gripped the wand -

// 5669
//“Hermione, __stop!__ It’s not going to work, Hermione, I don’t think we
//can make things that don’t exist yet!”

// 5670
//Slowly, Hermione’s hand relaxed its grasp on the wand.

// 5671
//“I thought I felt it,” she said in a bare whisper. “I thought I felt it start
//to Transfigure, just for a second.”

// 5672
//There was a lump in Harry’s throat. “You were probably imagining it. Hoping too
//hard.”

// 5673
//“I probably was,” she said. She looked like she wanted to cry.

// 5674
//Slowly, Harry took his mechanical pencil in his hand, and reached over to the
//sheet of paper with all the items crossed out, and drew a line through the item
//that said ‘ALZHEIMER’S CURE’.

// 5675
//They couldn’t have fed anyone a Transfigured pill. But Transfiguration, at
//least the kind they could do, didn’t enchant the targets - it wouldn’t
//Transfigure a regular broomstick into a flying one. So if Hermione had been
//able to make a pill at all, it would have been a __nonmagical__ pill, one
//that worked for ordinary material reasons. They could have secretly made pills
//for a Muggle science lab, let them __study__ the pills and try to
//reverse-engineer them before the Transfiguration wore off… no one in either
//world would need to know that magic had been involved, it would just be another
//scientific breakthrough…

// 5676
//It hadn’t been the sort of thing a wizard would think of, either. They didn’t
//respect mere __patterns of atoms__ that much, they didn’t think of
//unenchanted __material__ things as objects of power. If it wasn’t magical,
//it wasn’t interesting.

// 5677
//Earlier, Harry had __very__ secretly - he hadn’t even told Hermione -
//tried to Transfigure nanotechnology a la Eric Drexler. (He’d tried to produce a
//desktop nanofactory, of course, not tiny self-replicating assemblers, Harry
//wasn’t insane.) It would have been godhood in a single shot if it’d worked.

// 5678
//“That was it for today, right?” said Hermione. She was slumped back in her
//chair, leaning her head against the back; and her face showed her tiredness,
//which was very unusual for Hermione. She liked to pretend she was limitless, at
//least when Harry was around.

// 5679
//“One more,” Harry said cautiously, “but that one’s small, plus it might
//actually work. I saved it for last because I was hoping we could end on an up
//note. It’s real stuff, not like phasers. They’ve already made it in the
//laboratory, not like the Alzheimer’s cure. And it’s a generic substance, not
//specific like the lost books you tried to Transfigure copies of. I made a
//diagram of the molecular structure to show you. We just want to make it
//__longer__ than it’s ever been made before, and with all the tubes
//aligned, and the endpoints embedded in diamond.” Harry produced a sheet of
//graph paper.

// 5680
//Hermione sat back up, took it, and studied it, frowning. “These are
//__all__ carbon atoms? And Harry, what’s the name? I can’t Transfigure it
//if I don’t know what it’s called.”

// 5681
//Harry made a disgusted face. He was still having trouble getting used to that
//sort of thing, it shouldn’t matter what something was __named__ if you
//knew what it __was.__ “They’re called buckytubes, or carbon nanotubes.
//It’s a kind of fullerene that was discovered just this year. It’s about a
//hundred times stronger than steel and a sixth of the weight.”

// 5682
//Hermione looked up from the graph paper, her face surprised. “That’s
//__real?__”

// 5683
//“Yeah,” Harry said, “just hard to make the Muggle way. If we could get enough
//of the stuff, we could use it to build a space elevator all the way up to
//geosynchronous orbit or higher, and in terms of delta-v that’s halfway to
//anywhere in the Solar System. Plus we could throw out solar power satellites
//like confetti.”

// 5684
//Hermione was frowning again. “Is this stuff __safe?__”

// 5685
//“I don’t see why it wouldn’t be,” Harry said. “A buckytube is just a graphite
//sheet wrapped into a circular tube, basically, and graphite is the same stuff
//used in pencils -”

// 5686
//“I __know__ what graphite is, Harry,” Hermione said. She brushed her hair
//back absentmindedly, her eyebrows furrowed as she stared at the sheet of paper.

// 5687
//Harry reached into a pocket of his robes, and produced a white thread tied to
//two small gray plastic rings at either end. He’d added drops of superglue where
//the thread met either ring, to make it all a single object that could be
//Transfigured as a whole. Cyanoacrylate, if Harry remembered correctly, worked
//by covalent bonds, and that was as close to being a “solid object” as you ever
//got in a world ultimately composed of tiny individual atoms. “When you’re
//ready,” Harry said, “try to Transfigure this into a set of aligned buckytube
//fibers embedded in two solid diamond rings.”

// 5688
//“All right…” Hermione said slowly. “Harry, I feel like I just missed
//something.”

// 5689
//Harry shrugged helplessly. __Maybe you’re just tired.__ He knew better
//than to say it out loud, though.

// 5690
//Hermione laid her wand against one plastic ring, and stared for a while.

// 5691
//Two small circles of glittering diamond lay on the table, connected by a long
//black thread.

// 5692
//“It changed,” said Hermione. She sounded like she was trying to be enthusiastic
//but had run out of energy. “Now what?”

// 5693
//Harry felt a bit deflated by his research partner’s lack of passion, but did
//his best not to show it; maybe the same process would work in reverse to cheer
//her up. “Now I test it to see if it holds weight.”

// 5694
//There was an A-frame Harry had rigged up to do an earlier experiment with
//diamond rods - you could make solid diamond objects easily, using
//Transfiguration, they just wouldn’t last. The earlier experiment had measured
//whether Transfiguring a long diamond rod into a shorter diamond rod would allow
//it to lift a suspended heavy weight as it contracted, i.e., could you
//Transfigure against tension, which you in fact could.

// 5695
//Harry carefully looped one circle of glittering diamond over the thick metal
//hook at the top of the rig, then attached a thick metal hanger to the bottom
//ring, and then started attaching weights to the hanger.

// 5696
//(Harry had asked the Weasley twins to Transfigure the apparatus for him, and
//the Weasley twins had given him an incredulous look, like they couldn’t figure
//out what sort of prank he could __possibly__ want that for, but they
//hadn’t asked any questions. And their Transfigurations, according to them,
//lasted for around three hours, so Harry and Hermione still had a while left.)

// 5697
//“One hundred kilograms,” Harry said about a minute later. “I don’t think a
//steel thread this thin would hold that. It should go up much higher, but that’s
//all the weight I’ve got.”

// 5698
//There was a further silence.

// 5699
//Harry straightened up, and went back to their table, and sat down in his chair,
//and ceremoniously made a check mark next to ‘Buckytubes’. “There,” Harry said.
//“__That__ one worked.”

// 5700
//“But it’s not really __useful__, Harry, is it?” Hermione said from where
//she was sitting with her head resting in her hands. “I mean, even if we gave it
//to a scientist they couldn’t learn how to make lots of buckytubes from studying
//ours.”

// 5701
//“They might be able to learn __something,__” Harry said. “Hermione,
//__look__ at it, that little tiny thread holding up all that weight, we
//just made something that no Muggle laboratory could make -”

// 5702
//“But any other witch could make it,” Hermione said. Her exhaustion was coming
//into her voice, now. “Harry, I don’t think this is working out.”

// 5703
//“You mean our relationship?” Harry said. “Great! Let’s break up.”

// 5704
//That got a slight grin out of her. “I mean our research.”

// 5705
//“Oh, Hermione, how __could__ you?”

// 5706
//“You’re sweet when you’re mean,” she said. “But Harry, this is nuts, I’m
//twelve, you’re eleven, it’s __silly__ to think we’re going to discover
//anything that no one’s ever figured out before.”

// 5707
//“Are you really saying we should give up on unraveling the secrets of magic
//after trying for less than one__ month?__” Harry said, trying to put a
//note of challenge into his voice. Honestly he was feeling some of the same
//fatigue as Hermione. None of the __good__ ideas ever worked. He’d made
//just one discovery worth mentioning, the Mendelian pattern, and he couldn’t
//tell Hermione about it without breaking his promise to Draco.

// 5708
//“No,” Hermione said. Her young face was looking very serious and adult. “I’m
//saying right now we should be __studying__ all the magic that wizards
//already know, so we can do this sort of thing after we graduate from Hogwarts.”

// 5709
//“Um…” Harry said. “Hermione, I hate to put it this way, but imagine we’d
//decided to hold off on research until later, and the first thing we tried after
//we graduated was Transfiguring an Alzheimer’s cure, and it __worked.__
//We’d feel… I don’t think the word __stupid__ would adequately describe how
//we’d feel. What if there’s something else like that and it does work?”

// 5710
//“That’s not __fair,__ Harry!” Hermione said. Her voice was trembling like
//she was on the verge of breaking out crying. “You can’t __put__ that on
//people! It’s not our __job__ to do that sort of thing, we’re
//__kids!__”

// 5711
//For a moment Harry wondered what would happen if someone told Hermione she had
//to fight an immortal Dark Lord, if she would turn into one of the whiny
//self-pitying heroes that Harry could never stand reading about in his books.

// 5712
//“Anyway,” Hermione said. Her voice shook. “I don’t want to keep doing this. I
//don’t believe children can do things that grownups can’t, that’s only in
//stories.”

// 5713
//There was silence in the classroom.

// 5714
//Hermione started to look a little scared, and Harry knew that his own
//expression had gotten colder.

// 5715
//It might not have hurt so much if the same thought hadn’t already come to Harry
//- that, while thirty might be old for a scientific revolutionary and twenty
//about right, while there were people who got doctorates when they were
//seventeen and fourteen-year-old heirs who’d been great kings or generals, there
//wasn’t really anyone who’d made the history books at eleven.

// 5716
//“All right,” Harry said. “Figure out how to do something a grownup can’t. Is
//that your challenge?”

// 5717
//“I didn’t mean it like that,” Hermione said, her voice coming out in a
//frightened whisper.

// 5718
//With an effort, Harry wrenched his gaze away from Hermione. “I’m not angry at
//__you__,” Harry said. His voice was cold, despite his best efforts. “I’m
//angry at, I don’t know, everything. But I’m not willing to lose, Hermione.
//Losing isn’t always the right thing to do. I’ll figure out how to do something
//a grown wizard can’t do, and then I’ll get back to you. How’s that?”

// 5719
//There was more silence.

// 5720
//“Okay,” said Hermione, her voice wavering a little. She pushed herself up out
//of her chair, and went over to the door of the abandoned classroom they’d been
//working in. Her hand went onto the doorknob. “We’re still friends, right? And
//if you can’t figure out anything -”

// 5721
//Her voice halted.

// 5722
//“Then we’ll study together,” Harry said. His voice was even colder now.

// 5723
//“Um, bye for now, then,” Hermione said, and she quickly went out of the room
//and shut the door behind her.

// 5724
//Sometimes Harry hated having a dark side, even when he was inside it.

// 5725
//And the part of him that had thought exactly the same thing as Hermione, that
//no, children __couldn’t__ do what grownups couldn’t, was saying all the
//things that Hermione had been too frightened to say, like, __That’s one
//hell of a difficult challenge you just grabbed for yourself__ and __boy
//are you going to end up with egg on your face this time__ and __at least
//this way you’ll know you’ve failed.__

// 5726
//And the part of him that didn’t enjoy losing replied, in a very cold voice,
//__Fine, you can shut up and watch.__

// 5727
//It was almost lunchtime, and Harry didn’t care. He hadn’t even bothered
//grabbing a snack bar from his pouch. His stomach could stand a little starving.

// 5728
//The wizarding world was tiny, they didn’t think like scientists, they didn’t
//know science, they didn’t question what they’d grown up with, they hadn’t put
//protective shells on their time machines, they played Quidditch, all of magical
//Britain was smaller than a small Muggle city, the greatest wizarding school
//only educated up to the age of seventeen, __silly__ wasn’t challenging
//that at eleven, __silly__ was __assuming__ wizards knew what they
//were doing and had already exhausted all the low-hanging fruit a scientific
//polymath would see.

// 5729
//Step One had been to make a list of every magical constraint Harry could
//remember, all the things you supposedly couldn’t do.

// 5730
//Step Two, mark the constraints that seemed to make the __least__ sense
//from a scientific perspective.

// 5731
//Step Three, prioritize constraints that a wizard would be unlikely to question
//if they __didn’t__ know science.

// 5732
//Step Four, come up with avenues for attacking them.

// 5733
//Hermione still felt a little shaky as she sat down next to Mandy at the
//Ravenclaw table. Hermione’s lunch had two fruits (tomato slices and peeled
//tangerines), three vegetables (carrots, carrots, and more carrots), one meat
//(fried Diricawl drumsticks whose unhealthy coating she would carefully remove),
//and one little piece of chocolate cake that she would earn by eating the other
//parts.

// 5734
//It hadn’t been as bad as Potions class, sometimes she still had
//__nightmares__ about that. But this time __she__ had made it happen
//and __she’d felt like its target. __Just for a moment, before the terrible
//cold darkness looked away and said it wasn’t angry with her, because it hadn’t
//wanted to scare her.

// 5735
//And she still had that feeling like she’d missed something earlier, something
//really important.

// 5736
//But they hadn’t violated any of the rules of Transfiguration… had they? They
//hadn’t made any liquids, any gases, they hadn’t taken orders from the Defense
//Professor…

// 5737
//The __pill!__ That had been something to be eaten!

// 5738
//…well, no, nobody would just eat a pill lying around, it hadn’t __worked__
//actually, they could have just __Finite Incantatemed __it if it had, but
//she would still have to tell Harry about that and make sure they didn’t mention
//it in front of Professor McGonagall, in case they were never allowed to study
//Transfiguration again…

// 5739
//Hermione was starting to get a really sick feeling in her stomach. She pushed
//back her plate from the table, she couldn’t eat lunch like this.

// 5740
//And she closed her eyes and began to mentally recite the rules of
//Transfiguration.

// 5741
//__“I will never Transfigure anything into liquid or gas.”__

// 5742
//__“I will never Transfigure anything that looks like food or anything
//else that goes inside a human body.”__

// 5743
//No, they really __shouldn’t__ have tried to Transfigure the pill, or they
//should’ve at least __realized…__ she’d been so caught up in Harry’s
//brilliant idea that she hadn’t __thought…__

// 5744
//The sick feeling in Hermione’s stomach was getting worse. There was a feeling
//in her mind of something hovering just on the edge of recognition, a perception
//about to invert itself, a young woman about to become a crone, a vase about to
//become two faces…

// 5745
//And she went on remembering the rules of Transfiguration.

// 5746
//Harry’s knuckles had gone white on his wand by the time he stopped trying to
//Transfigure the air in front of his wand into a paperclip. It wouldn’t have
//been safe to Transfigure the paperclip into gas, of course, but Harry didn’t
//see any reason why it would be unsafe the other way around. It just wasn’t
//supposed to be __possible__. But why not? Air was as real a substance as
//anything else…

// 5747
//Well, maybe that limitation __did__ make sense. Air was disorganized, all
//the molecules constantly changing their relation to each other. Maybe you
//couldn’t impose a new form on substance unless the substance was staying still
//long enough for you to master it, even though the atoms in solids were also
//constantly vibrating all the time…

// 5748
//The more Harry failed, the colder he felt, the clearer everything seemed to
//become.

// 5749
//All right. Next on the list.

// 5750
//You could only Transfigure whole objects as wholes. You couldn’t Transfigure
//__half__ a match into a needle, you had to Transfigure the __whole
//thing.__ Back when Harry had been trapped in that classroom by Draco, it had
//been the reason he couldn’t just Transfigure a thin cylindrical cross-section
//of the walls into sponge, and punch out a chunk of stone large enough for him
//to fit through the hole. He would have needed to impose a new form on the whole
//wall, and maybe a whole section of Hogwarts, just in order to change that
//little cross-section.

// 5751
//And that was __ridiculous__.

// 5752
//__Things were made of atoms.__ Lots of little tiny dots. There
//__was__ no contiguity, there __was__ no solidity, just
//electromagnetic forces holding the little dots related to each other…

// 5753
//Mandy Brocklehurst paused with her fork on her way to her mouth. “Huh,” she
//said to Su Li, sitting across from the now-empty space beside her, “what got
//into Hermione?”

// 5754
//Harry wanted to kill his eraser.

// 5755
//He’d been trying to change a single spot on the pink rectangle into steel,
//apart from the rest of the rubber, and the eraser wasn’t cooperating.

// 5756
//It __had__ to be a conceptual limitation, not a real one. __Had__ to
//be.

// 5757
//__Things were made of atoms,__ and every atom was a tiny separate thing.
//Atoms were held together by a quantum mist of shared electrons, for covalent
//bonds, or sometimes just magnetism at close ranges, for ionic bonds or van der
//Waals forces.

// 5758
//If it came down to that, the protons and neutrons inside the nuclei were tiny
//separate things. The quarks inside the protons and neutrons were tiny separate
//things! There simply __wasn’t__ anything in reality, the world-out-there,
//that corresponded to people’s conceit of solid objects. It was all just little
//dots.

// 5759
//And free Transfiguration was all in the mind to begin with, wasn’t it? No
//words, no gestures. Only the pure concept of form, kept strictly separate from
//substance, imposed on the substance, conceived of apart from its form. That and
//the wand and whatever made you a wizard.

// 5760
//The wizards couldn’t transform parts of things, could only transform what their
//minds perceived as wholes, because they didn’t __know in their bones__
//that it was all just atoms deep down.

// 5761
//Harry had focused on that knowledge as hard as he could, the __true fact__
//that the eraser was just a collection of atoms, everything was just collections
//of atoms, and the atoms of the little patch he was trying to Transfigure formed
//__just as valid__ a collection as any other collection he cared to think
//about.

// 5762
//And Harry still hadn’t been able to change that single part of the eraser, the
//Transfiguration wasn’t going anywhere.

// 5763
//__This. Was. Ridiculous.__

// 5764
//Harry’s knuckles were whitening on his wand again. He was __sick__ of
//getting experimental results that __didn’t make sense.__

// 5765
//Maybe the fact that __some__ part of his mind was still thinking in terms
//of objects was stopping the Transfiguration from going through. He had thought
//of a collection of atoms that was an __eraser.__ He had thought of a
//collection that was a __little patch.__

// 5766
//Time to kick it up a notch.

// 5767
//Harry pressed his wand harder against that tiny section of eraser, and tried to
//see through the illusion that nonscientists thought was reality, the world of
//desks and chairs, air and erasers and people.

// 5768
//When you walked through a park, the immersive world that surrounded you was
//something that existed inside your own brain as a pattern of neurons firing.
//The sensation of a bright blue sky wasn’t something high above you, it was
//something in your visual cortex, and your visual cortex was in the back of your
//brain. All the sensations of that bright world were really happening in that
//quiet cave of bone you called your skull, the place where __you__ lived
//and never, ever left. If you really wanted to say hello to someone, to the
//__actual person,__ you wouldn’t shake their hand, you’d knock gently on
//their skull and say “How are you doing in there?” That was what people were,
//that was where they really lived. And the __picture__ of the park that you
//thought you were __walking through__ was something that was visualized
//inside your brain as it processed the signals sent down from your eyes and
//retina.

// 5769
//It wasn’t a __lie__ like the Buddhists thought, there wasn’t something
//terribly mystical and unexpected behind the veil of Maya, what lay beyond the
//illusion of the park was just the __actual park__, but it was all still
//__illusion__.

// 5770
//Harry wasn’t sitting inside the classroom.

// 5771
//He wasn’t looking at the eraser.

// 5772
//Harry was inside Harry’s skull.

// 5773
//He was experiencing a processed picture his brain had decoded from the signals
//sent down by his retina.

// 5774
//The real eraser was somewhere else, somewhere that wasn’t the picture.

// 5775
//And the real eraser wasn’t like the picture Harry’s brain had of it. The idea
//of the eraser as a __solid object__ was something that existed only inside
//his own brain, inside the parietal cortex that processed his sense of shape and
//space. The real eraser was a collection of atoms held together by
//electromagnetic forces and shared covalent electrons, while nearby, air
//molecules bounced off each other and bounced off the eraser-molecules.

// 5776
//The real eraser was far away, and Harry, inside his skull, could never quite
//touch it, could only imagine ideas about it. But __his wand had the
//power,__ it could change things out there in __reality__, it was only
//Harry’s own preconceptions that were __limiting__ it. Somewhere beyond the
//veil of Maya, the __truth__ behind Harry’s concept of “my wand” was
//touching the collection of atoms that Harry’s mind thought of as “a patch on
//the eraser”, and if that wand could change the collection of atoms that Harry
//considered “the whole eraser”, there was absolutely no reason why it couldn’t
//change the other collection too…

// 5777
//The Transfiguration still wasn’t going through.

// 5778
//Harry’s teeth clenched together, and he kicked it up __another__ notch.

// 5779
//The concept Harry’s mind had of the eraser as a single object was
//__obvious nonsense.__

// 5780
//It was a map that didn’t and __couldn’t__ match the territory.

// 5781
//Human beings modeled the world using stratified levels of organization, they
//had __separate thoughts__ about how countries worked, how people worked,
//how organs worked, how cells worked, how molecules worked, how quarks worked.

// 5782
//When Harry’s brain needed to think about the eraser, it would think about the
//rules that governed erasers, like “erasers can get rid of pencil-marks”. Only
//if Harry’s brain needed to predict what would happen on the lower chemical
//level, only then would Harry’s brain start thinking - as though it were a
//separate fact - about rubber molecules.

// 5783
//But that was all in the __mind.__

// 5784
//Harry’s mind might have separate __beliefs__ about rules that governed
//erasers, but there was no __separate law of physics__ that governed
//erasers.

// 5785
//Harry’s mind modeled reality using multiple levels of organization, with
//different beliefs about each level. But that was all in the __map,__ the
//true territory wasn’t like that, __reality itself__ had only a
//__single__ level of organization, the quarks, it was a unified low-level
//process obeying mathematically simple rules.

// 5786
//Or at least that was what Harry had believed before he’d found out about magic,
//but the eraser wasn’t magical.

// 5787
//And even if the eraser __had__ been magical, the idea that there could
//__really exist__ a single solid eraser was __impossible.__ Things
//like erasers __couldn’t__ be basic elements of reality, they were too big
//and complicated to be atoms, they __had__ to be made of parts__.
//__You couldn’t have things that were __fundamentally complicated__. The
//implicit belief that Harry’s brain had in the eraser as a single object wasn’t
//just __wrong,__ it was a map-territory confusion, the eraser only existed
//as a separate concept in Harry’s multi-level __model __of the world, not
//as a separate element of single-level reality.

// 5788
//…the Transfiguration __still wasn’t happening.__

// 5789
//Harry was breathing heavily, failed Transfiguration was almost as tiring as
//successful Transfiguration, but __damned__ if he’d give up now.

// 5790
//All right, screw this nineteenth-century garbage.

// 5791
//Reality wasn’t atoms, it wasn’t a set of tiny billiard balls bopping around.
//That was just another lie. The notion of atoms as little dots was just another
//convenient hallucination that people clung to because they didn’t want to
//confront the inhumanly alien shape of the underlying reality. No wonder, then,
//that his attempts to Transfigure based on that hadn’t worked. If he wanted
//power, he had to abandon his humanity, and force his thoughts to conform to the
//true math of quantum mechanics.

// 5792
//There__ were no particles, __there were just __clouds of amplitude__
//in a __multiparticle configuration space__ and what his brain fondly
//imagined to be an eraser was nothing except a gigantic __factor__ in a
//wavefunction that __happened to factorize__, it didn’t have a separate
//existence any more than there was a particular solid factor of 3 hidden inside
//the number 6, if his wand was capable of __altering factors in an
//approximately factorizable wavefunction__ then it should damn well be able to
//alter the slightly __smaller__ factor that Harry’s brain visualized as a
//patch of material on the eraser -

// 5793
//Hermione tore through the hallways, shoes pounding hard on the stone, breath
//coming in pants, the shock of adrenaline still racing through her blood.

// 5794
//Like a picture of a young woman turning into an old crone, like the cup
//becoming two faces.

// 5795
//What had they been doing?

// 5796
//__What had they been doing?__

// 5797
//She came to the classroom and her fingers slipped on the doorknob at first, too
//sweaty, she grabbed harder and the door opened -

// 5798
//- in a single flash of perception she saw Harry staring at a small pink
  //rectangle on the table in front of him -

// 5799
//- as a few paces away the tiny black thread, almost invisible from this
  //distance, supported all that weight -

// 5800
//__“Harry get out of the classroom!”__

// 5801
//Pure shock crossed Harry’s face, and he stood up so fast he almost fell over,
//stopping only to grab the small pink rectangle from the table, and he tore out
//of the door, she’d already stepped aside, her wand was already in her hand
//coming up pointing at the thread -

// 5802
//“__Finite Incantatem!__”

// 5803
//And Hermione slammed the door shut again, just as the gigantic crash of a
//hundred kilograms of falling metal came from inside.

// 5804
//She was panting, gasping for air, she’d run all the way here without stopping,
//she was soaked in sweat and her legs and thighs burned like living flames, she
//couldn’t have answered Harry’s questions for all the Galleons in the world.

// 5805
//Hermione blinked, and realized that she had started to fall, and Harry had
//caught her, and was lowering her gently to sit on the floor.

// 5806
//“…healthy…” she managed to whisper.

// 5807
//“__What?__” said Harry, looking paler than she’d ever seen him.

// 5808
//“…are you, feeling, healthy…”

// 5809
//Harry started looking even more frightened as the question sank in. “I, I don’t
//think I have any symptoms -”

// 5810
//Hermione closed her eyes for a moment. “Good,” she whispered. “Catch, breath.”

// 5811
//That took a while. Harry was still looking scared. That was good too, maybe it
//would teach him a lesson.

// 5812
//Hermione reached into the pouch Harry had bought her, whispered “water” through
//her parched throat, took out the bottle and drank in great huge gulps.

// 5813
//And then it was still a while before she could talk again.

// 5814
//“We broke the rules, Harry,” she said in a hoarse voice. “We broke the rules.”

// 5815
//“I…” Harry swallowed. “I still don’t see how, I’ve been __thinking__ but
//-”

// 5816
//“I asked if the Transfiguration was safe and __you answered me!__”

// 5817
//There was a pause.

// 5818
//“That’s it?” Harry said.

// 5819
//She could have screamed.

// 5820
//“Harry, don’t you get it?” she said. “It’s made out of tiny fibers, what if it
//__unraveled,__ who __knows__ what could go wrong, __we didn’t
//ask Professor McGonagall!__ Don’t you see what we were doing? We were
//experimenting with Transfiguration. We were __experimenting__ with
//__Transfiguration!__”

// 5821
//There was another pause.

// 5822
//“Right…” Harry said slowly. “That’s probably one of those things they don’t
//even bother telling you __not__ to do because it’s too obvious. Don’t test
//brilliant new ideas for Transfiguration by yourselves in an unused classroom
//without consulting any professors.”

// 5823
//“You could have gotten us killed, Harry!” Hermione knew it wasn’t fair, she’d
//made the mistake too, but she still felt angry at him, he always sounded so
//confident and that had dragged her unthinkingly along in his wake. “We could
//have __spoiled Professor McGonagall’s perfect record!__”

// 5824
//“Yes,” said Harry, “let’s not tell her about this, shall we?”

// 5825
//“We have to stop,” Hermione said. “We have to stop this or we’re going to get
//hurt. We’re too young, Harry, we can’t do this, not yet.”

// 5826
//A weak grin crossed Harry’s face. “Um, you’re sort of wrong about that.”

// 5827
//And he held out a small pink rectangle, a rubber eraser with a bright metal
//patch on it.

// 5828
//Hermione stared at it, puzzled.

// 5829
//“Quantum mechanics wasn’t enough,” Harry said. “I had to go all the way down to
//timeless physics before it took. Had to see the wand as enforcing a
//__relation__ between separate past and future realities, instead of
//__changing__ anything over time - but I did it, Hermione, I saw past the
//illusion of objects, and I bet there’s not a single other wizard in the world
//who could have. Even if some Muggleborn knew about timeless formulations of
//quantum mechanics, it would just be a weird belief about strange distant
//quantum stuff, they wouldn’t __see__ that it was __reality__, accept
//that the world they knew was just a hallucination. I Transfigured __part__
//of the eraser without changing the __whole thing.__”

// 5830
//Hermione raised her wand again, pointed it at the eraser.

// 5831
//For a moment anger crossed Harry’s face, but he didn’t make any move to stop
//her.

// 5832
//“__Finite Incantatem__,” said Hermione. “Check with Professor McGonagall
//before you try it again.”

// 5833
//Harry nodded, though his face was still a bit tight.

// 5834
//“And we still have to stop,” said Hermione.

// 5835
//“__Why?__” said Harry. “Don’t you see what this __means__, Hermione?
//Wizards __don’t__ know everything! There’s too few of them, even fewer who
//know any science, they haven’t exhausted the low-hanging fruit -”

// 5836
//“It’s not __safe__,” Hermione said. “If we __can__ find out new
//things it’s even __less__ safe! We’re __too young!__ We made one big
//mistake already, next time we could just __die!__”

// 5837
//Then Hermione flinched.

// 5838
//Harry looked away from her, and started taking slow, deep breaths.

// 5839
//“Please don’t try to do it alone, Harry,” Hermione said, her voice trembling.
//“Please.”

// 5840
//__Please don’t make me have to decide whether to tell Professor
//Flitwick.__

// 5841
//There was a long pause.

// 5842
//“So you want us to study,” Harry said. She could tell he was trying to keep the
//anger out of his voice. “Just study.”

// 5843
//Hermione wasn’t sure if she should say anything, but… “Like you studied, um,
//timeless physics, right?”

// 5844
//Harry looked back at her.

// 5845
//“That thing you did,” Hermione said, her voice tentative, “it wasn’t because of
//__our__ experiments, right? You could do it because you’d read lots of
//books.”

// 5846
//Harry opened his mouth, and then he shut it again. There was a frustrated look
//on his face.

// 5847
//“All right,” Harry said. “How about this. We study, and if I think of anything
//that seems __really__ worth trying, we’ll try it after I ask a professor.”

// 5848
//“Okay,” Hermione said. She didn’t fall over with relief, but only because she
//was already sitting down.

// 5849
//“Shall we get lunch?” Harry said cautiously.

// 5850
//Hermione nodded. Yes. Lunch sounded good. For real, this time.

// 5851
//She carefully began to push herself off the stone floor, wincing as her body
//screamed at her -

// 5852
//Harry pointed his wand at her and said “__Wingardium Leviosa.__”

// 5853
//Hermione blinked as the huge weight on her legs diminished to something
//bearable.

// 5854
//A smile quirked across Harry’s face. “You can __lift__ something without
//being able to Hover it completely,” he said. “Remember that experiment?”

// 5855
//Hermione smiled back helplessly, although she thought she ought to still be
//angry.

// 5856
//And she started walking back toward the Great Hall, feeling remarkably and
//wonderfully light on her feet, as Harry carefully kept his wand trained on her.

// 5857
//He only managed to keep it up for five minutes, but it was the thought that
//counted.

// 5858
//Minerva looked at Dumbledore.

// 5859
//Dumbledore gazed back inquiringly at her. “Did you understand any of that?” the
//Headmaster said, sounding bemused.

// 5860
//It had been the most complete and utter gibberish that Minerva could ever
//remember hearing. She was feeling a bit embarrassed about having summoned the
//Headmaster to hear it, but she’d been given explicit instructions.

// 5861
//“I’m afraid not,” Professor McGonagall said primly.

// 5862
//“So,” Dumbledore said. The silver beard swung away from her, the old wizard’s
//twinkling gaze looked elsewhere once more. “You suspect you might be able to do
//something that other wizards can’t do, something we think is impossible.”

// 5863
//The three of them stood within the Headmaster’s private Transfiguration
//workroom, where the shining phoenix of Dumbledore’s Patronus had told her to
//bring Harry, moments after her own Patronus had reached him. Light shone down
//through the skylights and illuminated the great seven-pointed alchemical
//diagram drawn in the center of the circular room, showing it to be a little
//dusty, which saddened Minerva. Transfiguration research was one of Dumbledore’s
//great enjoyments, and she’d known how pressed for time he’d been lately, but
//not that he was __this__ pressed.

// 5864
//And now Harry Potter was going to waste even more of the Headmaster’s time. But
//she certainly couldn’t blame __Harry__ for that. He’d done the proper
//thing in coming to her to say that he’d had an idea for doing something in
//Transfiguration that was currently believed to be impossible, and she herself
//had done exactly what she’d been told to do: she’d ordered Harry to be quiet
//and not discuss anything with her until she had consulted the Headmaster and
//they’d finished moving to a secure location.

// 5865
//If Harry had started out by saying what __specifically__ he thought he
//could do, she wouldn’t have bothered.

// 5866
//“Look, I know it’s hard to explain,” Harry said, sounding a little embarrassed.
//“What it adds up to is that what you believe conflicts with what scientists
//believe, in a case where I’d genuinely expect scientists to know more than
//wizards.”

// 5867
//Minerva would have sighed out loud, if Dumbledore hadn’t seemed to be taking
//the whole thing very seriously.

// 5868
//Harry’s idea stemmed from simple ignorance, nothing more. If you changed half
//of a metal ball into glass, the __whole ball__ had a different Form. To
//change the part __was__ to change the whole, and that meant removing the
//whole Form and replacing it with a different one. What would it even
//__mean__ to Transfigure only half of a metal ball? That the metal ball
//__as a whole__ had the same Form as before, but __half__ that ball
//now had a different Form?

// 5869
//“Mr. Potter,” said Professor McGonagall, “what you want to do isn’t just
//impossible, it’s __illogical.__ If you change half of something, you
//__did__ change the whole.”

// 5870
//“Indeed,” said Dumbledore. “But Harry is the hero, so he may be able to do
//things that are logically impossible.”

// 5871
//Minerva would have rolled her eyes, if she hadn’t gone numb a long time ago.

// 5872
//“Supposing it __was__ possible,” said Dumbledore, “can you think of any
//reason why the results would differ in any way from ordinary Transfiguration?”

// 5873
//Minerva frowned. The fact that the concept was literally unimaginable was
//presenting her with some difficulty, but she tried to take it at face value. A
//Transfiguration imposed on only half of a metal ball…

// 5874
//“Strange things happening at the interface?” said Minerva. “But that should be
//no different than Transfiguring the object as a whole, into a Form with two
//different parts…”

// 5875
//Dumbledore nodded. “That is my own thought as well. And Harry, if your theory
//is correct, it implies that what you want to do is __exactly__ like any
//other Transfiguration, only applied to a part of the subject rather than the
//whole? No changes __at all?__”

// 5876
//“Yes,” Harry said firmly. “That’s the whole point.”

// 5877
//Dumbledore looked at her again. “Minerva, can you think of any reason
//whatsoever why that would be dangerous?”

// 5878
//“No,” said Minerva, after she had finished searching through her memory.

// 5879
//“Likewise myself,” said the Headmaster. “All right, then, since this ought to
//be exactly analogous to ordinary Transfiguration in all respects, and since we
//cannot think of any reason whatsoever why it would be dangerous, I think that
//the second degree of caution will suffice.”

// 5880
//Minerva was surprised, but she didn’t object. Dumbledore was by far her senior
//in Transfiguration, and he had tried literally thousands of new
//Transfigurations without ever choosing a degree of caution that was too low. He
//had used Transfiguration __in combat__ and he was __still alive.__ If
//the Headmaster thought the second degree was enough, it was enough.

// 5881
//That Harry was certainly going to fail was, of course, completely irrelevant.

// 5882
//The two of them started setting up the wards and detection webs. The most
//important web was the one that checked to make sure no Transfigured material
//had entered the air. Harry would be enclosed in a separate shell of force with
//its own air supply just to be certain, only his wand allowed to leave the
//shield, and the interface tight. They were inside Hogwarts so they couldn’t
//automatically Apparate out any material that showed signs of spontaneous
//combustion, but they could launch it out a skylight almost as fast, the windows
//all folded outward for exactly that reason. Harry himself would go out a
//different skylight at the first sign of trouble.

// 5883
//Harry watched them working, his face looking a little frightened.

// 5884
//“Don’t worry,” said Professor McGonagall in the middle of her running
//description, “this almost certainly won’t be necessary, Mr. Potter. If we
//__expected__ anything to go wrong you would not be allowed to try. It’s
//just ordinary precautions for any Transfiguration no one has ever tried
//before.”

// 5885
//Harry swallowed and nodded.

// 5886
//And a few minutes later, Harry was strapped into the safety chair and resting
//his wand against a metal ball - one that, based on his current test scores,
//should have been too large for him to Transfigure in less than thirty minutes.

// 5887
//And a few minutes after __that,__ Minerva was leaning against the wall,
//feeling faint.

// 5888
//There was a small patch of glass on the ball where Harry’s wand had rested.

// 5889
//Harry didn’t say __I told you so,__ but the smug look on his sweating face
//said it for him.

// 5890
//Dumbledore was casting analytic Charms on the ball, looking more and more
//intrigued by the moment. Thirty years had melted off his face.

// 5891
//“Fascinating,” said Dumbledore. “It’s exactly as he claimed. He simply
//Transfigured a part of the subject without Transfiguring the whole. You say
//it’s really just a conceptual limitation, Harry?”

// 5892
//“Yes,” Harry said, “but a deep one, just knowing it had to be a conceptual
//limitation wasn’t enough. I had to suppress the part of my mind that was making
//the error and think instead about the underlying reality that scientists
//figured out.”

// 5893
//“Truly fascinating,” Dumbledore said. “I take it that for any other wizard to
//do the same would require months of study if they could do it at all? And may I
//ask you to partially Transfigure some other subjects?”

// 5894
//“Probably yes and of course,” Harry said.

// 5895
//Half an hour later, Minerva was feeling equally bewildered, but considerably
//reassured about the safety issues.

// 5896
//It __was__ the same, aside from being logically impossible.

// 5897
//“I believe that’s enough, Headmaster,” Minerva said finally. “I suspect partial
//Transfiguration is more tiring than the ordinary sort.”

// 5898
//“Getting less so with practice,” said the exhausted and pale boy, voice
//unsteady, “but yeah, you’ve got that right.”

// 5899
//The process of extracting Harry from the wards took another minute, and then
//Minerva escorted him to a much more comfortable chair, and Dumbledore produced
//an ice-cream soda.

// 5900
//“__Congratulations__, Mr. Potter!” said Professor McGonagall, and meant
//it. She would have bet almost anything against that working.

// 5901
//“Congratulations indeed,” said Dumbledore. “Even I did not make any original
//discoveries in Transfiguration before the age of fourteen. Not since the day of
//Dorotea Senjak has any genius flowered so early.”

// 5902
//“Thanks,” Harry said, sounding a little surprised.

// 5903
//“Nonetheless,” Dumbledore said thoughtfully, “I think it would be most wise to
//keep this happy event a secret, at least for now. Harry, did you discuss your
//idea with any other person before you spoke to Professor McGonagall?”

// 5904
//There was silence.

// 5905
//“Um…” Harry said. “I don’t want to turn anyone over to the Inquisition, but I
//did tell one other student -”

// 5906
//The word almost exploded from Professor McGonagall’s lips. “__What?__ You
//discussed a completely novel form of Transfiguration with a __student__
//before consulting a recognized authority? Do you have any idea how
//__irresponsible__ that was?”

// 5907
//“I’m sorry,” said Harry. “I didn’t realize.”

// 5908
//The boy looked appropriately frightened, and Minerva felt something inside her
//relax. At least Harry understood how foolish he’d been.

// 5909
//“You must swear Miss Granger to secrecy,” Dumbledore said gravely. “And do not
//tell anyone else unless there is an extremely good reason for it, and they too
//have sworn.”

// 5910
//“Ah… why?” Harry said.

// 5911
//Minerva was wondering the same thing. Once again the Headmaster was thinking
//too far ahead for her to keep up.

// 5912
//“Because you can do something that no one else will believe you can do,”
//Dumbledore said. “Something completely unexpected. It may prove to be your
//critical advantage, Harry, and we must preserve it. Please, trust me in this.”

// 5913
//Professor McGonagall nodded, her firm face showing nothing of her inner
//confusion. “Please do, Mr. Potter,” she said.

// 5914
//“All right…” Harry said slowly.

// 5915
//“Once we have finished examining your materials,” Dumbledore added, “you may
//practice partial Transfiguration, on glass to steel and steel to glass
//__only__, with Miss Granger to act as your spotter. Naturally, if either
//of you suspect any symptom of any form of Transfiguration sickness, inform a
//professor at once.”

// 5916
//Just before Harry left the workroom, with his hand on the doorhandle, the boy
//turned back and said, “As long as we’re here, have either of you noticed
//anything different about Professor Snape?”

// 5917
//“Different?” said the Headmaster.

// 5918
//Minerva didn’t let her wry smile show on her face. Of course the boy was
//apprehensive about the ‘evil Potions Master’, since he had no way of knowing
//why Severus was to be trusted. It would have been odd to say the least,
//explaining to Harry that Severus was still in love with his mother.

// 5919
//“I mean, has his behavior changed recently in any way?” said Harry.

// 5920
//“Not that I have seen…” the Headmaster said slowly. “Why do you ask?”

// 5921
//Harry shook his head. “I don’t want to prejudice your own observations by
//saying. Just keep an eye out, maybe?”

// 5922
//That sent a quiver of unease through Minerva in a way that no outright
//accusation of Severus could have.

// 5923
//Harry bowed to both of them respectfully, and took his leave.

// 5924
//“Albus,” Minerva said after the boy had gone, “how did you __know__ to
//take Harry seriously? I would have thought his idea merely impossible!”

// 5925
//The old wizard’s face turned grave. “The same reason it must be kept secret,
//Minerva. The same reason I told you to come to me, if Harry made any such
//claim. Because it is a power that Voldemort knows not.”

// 5926
//The words took a few seconds to sink in.

// 5927
//And then the cold shiver went down her spine, as it always did when she
//remembered.

// 5928
//It had started out as an ordinary job interview, Sybill Trelawney applying for
//the position of Professor of Divination.

// 5929
//__THE ONE WITH THE POWER TO VANQUISH THE DARK LORD APPROACHES,__

// 5930
//__BORN TO THOSE WHO HAVE THRICE DEFIED HIM,__

// 5931
//__BORN AS THE SEVENTH MONTH DIES,__

// 5932
//__AND THE DARK LORD WILL MARK HIM AS HIS EQUAL,__

// 5933
//__BUT HE WILL HAVE POWER THE DARK LORD KNOWS NOT,__

// 5934
//__AND EITHER MUST DESTROY ALL BUT A REMNANT OF THE OTHER,__

// 5935
//__FOR THOSE TWO DIFFERENT SPIRITS CANNOT EXIST IN THE SAME WORLD.__

// 5936
//Those dreadful words, spoken in that terrible booming voice, didn’t seem to fit
//something like partial Transfiguration.

// 5937
//“Perhaps not, then,” Dumbledore said after Minerva tried to explain. “I confess
//I had been hoping for something that would help in finding Voldemort’s horcrux,
//wherever he may have hidden it. But…” The old wizard shrugged. “Prophecies are
//tricky things, Minerva, and it is best to take no chances. The smallest thing
//may prove decisive if it remains unexpected.”

// 5938
//“And what do you suppose he meant about __Severus?__” said Minerva.

// 5939
//“There I have no idea,” sighed Dumbledore. “Unless Harry is making a move
//against Severus, and thought that an open question might be taken seriously
//where a direct allegation would be dismissed. And if that was indeed what
//happened, Harry correctly reasoned that I would not trust that it was so. Let
//us simply keep watch, without prejudice, as he asks.”

// 5940
//__Aftermath, 1:__

// 5941
//“Um, Hermione?” Harry said in a very small voice. “I think I owe you a really,
//really, really big apology.”

// 5942
//__Aftermath, 2:__

// 5943
//Alissa Cornfoot’s eyes were slightly glazed as she gazed upon the Potions
//Master giving her class a stern lecture, holding up a tiny bronze bean and
//saying something about screaming puddles of human flesh. Ever since the start
//of this year she’d been having trouble listening in Potions. She kept staring
//at their awful, mean, greasy professor and fantasizing about special
//detentions. There was probably something really __wrong__ with her but she
//just couldn’t seem to stop doing it -

// 5944
//“Ow!” Alissa said then.

// 5945
//Snape had just flicked the bronze bean unerringly at Alissa’s forehead.

// 5946
//“Miss Cornfoot,” said the Potions Master, his voice cutting, “this is a
//delicate potion and if you cannot pay attention you will hurt your classmates,
//not just yourself. See me after class.”

// 5947
//The last four words didn’t help her any, but she tried harder, and managed to
//get through the day without melting anyone.

// 5948
//After class, Alissa approached the desk. Part of her wanted to stand there
//meekly with her face abashed and her hands clasped penitently behind her back,
//just in case, but some quiet instinct told her this might be a __bad
//idea__. So instead she just stood there with her face neutral, in a posture that
//was very proper for a young lady, and said, “Professor?”

// 5949
//“Miss Cornfoot,” Snape said without looking up from the sheets he was grading,
//“I do not return your affections, I begin to find your stares disturbing, and
//you will restrain your eyes henceforth. Is that quite clear?”

// 5950
//“Yes,” said Alissa in a strangled squeak, and Snape dismissed her, and she fled
//the classroom with her cheeks flaming like molten lava.
