//Harry stood now before the gargoyles that guarded the Headmaster’s - no, the
//Headmistress’s office. He had been summoned by Professor Sinistra, told that it
//was an emergency, but the gates were not opening for him.

// 19541
//Experiment had showed that the Stone made one Transfiguration permanent every
//three minutes and fifty-four seconds, irrespective of the size of object
//Transfigured. Just once, holding the Philosopher’s Stone up to the light of
//Harry’s most powerful flashlight in an otherwise darkened closet, Harry had
//thought he’d seen an array of tiny points inside the chunk of crimson glass;
//but Harry hadn’t been able to see it again, and now suspected himself of having
//imagined it. The Stone had no other powers that Harry could detect, nor did it
//respond to any attempted mental commands.

// 19542
//Harry had given himself until noon tomorrow to figure out how to begin using
//the Stone without it being grabbed by someone else, trying not to think about
//what was still happening, what had always been happening, in the meanwhile.

// 19543
//Ten minutes late, Minerva McGonagall approached, moving in a swift stride. Her
//arms were full of papers, she was once again wearing the Sorting Hat.

// 19544
//The gargoyles, with a brief sound of grinding stone, bowed low before her.

// 19545
//“The new password is ‘Impermanence’,” Minerva said to the gargoyles, and they
//stepped aside. “I’m sorry, Mr. Potter, I was delayed -”

// 19546
//“Understood.”

// 19547
//Minerva mounted the long spiral stairs, climbing instead of waiting to be
//carried, Harry following behind her.

// 19548
//“We are meeting with Amelia Bones, Director of the Department of Magical Law
//Enforcement; with Alastor Moody, whom you have met; and with Bartemius Crouch,
//Director of the Department of International Magical Cooperation,” Minerva said
//as she climbed. “They are Dumbledore’s heirs as much as you or I.”

// 19549
//“How - how’s Hermione doing?” Harry hadn’t had a chance to ask until now.

// 19550
//“Filius said she seemed rather in shock, which I suppose is not surprising. She
//asked where you were, was told you were at a Quidditch game, asked where you
//really were, and refused to speak with anyone about what happened until she was
//allowed to talk with you. She was taken to St. Mungo’s, where,” the
//Headmistress now sounded slightly perturbed, “a standard diagnostic Charm
//showed Miss Granger as a healthy unicorn in excellent physical condition except
//that her mane needs combing. Charms to detect active magic have each time
//detected her as being in the process of transforming into another shape. There
//was an Unspeakable who showed up before Filius, ah, removed him. He performed
//certain spells he probably ought not to have known, and declared that
//Hermione’s soul was in healthy condition but at least a mile away from her
//body. At that point the senior healers gave up. She’s currently alone in a cell
//with the rats and flies -”

// 19551
//“She’s what?”

// 19552
//“I’m sorry, Mr. Potter, that’s Transfiguration jargon. Miss Granger is in an
//isolation chamber with a cage of tame rats, and a box of flies that will bear
//offspring in a single day. Logic suggests that whatever mystery underlies her
//resurrection, it left behind an emanation that is causing the healers’ Charms
//to produce gibberish. But if nothing happens to the rats or to the flies’
//offspring, Miss Granger will be declared safe to return to Hogwarts after she
//wakes up again tomorrow morning.”

// 19553
//Harry still wasn’t sure… wasn’t sure at __all__, what Hermione would think
//of having been resurrected, at least under these particular circumstances. He
//didn’t actually think Hermione would yell at him for doing it wrong. That was
//just Harry’s brain trying to imagine her as a stereotype. Harry had been
//legitimately exhausted and not thinking very straight when he’d come up with
//that cover story, and Hermione would probably understand that part. But he
//couldn’t imagine what Hermione __would__ think…

// 19554
//“I wonder how Miss Granger will feel about having also vanquished
//You-Know-Who,” Minerva said reflectively, climbing the moving stairs fast
//enough that Harry felt out of breath trying to keep up. “And people believing
//the most interesting things about her.”

// 19555
//“You mean, because she’s always self-identified as a normal academic genius,
//and now a bunch of people think of her as the Girl-Who-Revived and everyone
//wants to shake her hand?” Harry said. __Even though she doesn’t remember
//doing anything to earn it. Even though it was all someone else’s work and other
//people’s sacrifices, and she’s getting the credit. Even though she doesn’t feel
//like she’s actually done anything worthy of the way other people treat her, and
//she’s not sure if she can ever live up to the person they imagine. __“Gosh, I
//don’t know, I can’t imagine what that feels like.”
//! 7%

// 19556
//__Maybe I shouldn’t have subjected her to it. But people had to be given
//__something__ to believe or heaven knows what they’d have made up. Feeling
//guilty about this would be stupid. I think.__

// 19557
//The two of them reached the top of the stairs, and came into the office filled
//with dozens of strange objects, all facing a great desk and a mighty throne
//behind it.

// 19558
//Minerva’s hand passed over one of those objects, the one with golden wibblers,
//her eyes closing briefly. Then Minerva took off the Sorting Hat and put it on a
//hatrack that held three slippers for left feet. She transformed the mighty
//throne into a simple cushioned chair and the great desk into a round table,
//around which four other chairs rose up.

// 19559
//Harry watched it all with a strange pang in his throat. He knew, without either
//of them saying anything, that there should have been more ceremony for the
//changing of the chairs, the changing of the table. Much more ceremony, for the
//first time the Headmistress sat down in her new office. But for whatever
//reason, there wasn’t time, and Minerva McGonagall was discarding all that for
//speed.

// 19560
//A wave of Minerva’s wand lit the Floo-fire in the fireplace, even as Minerva
//sat down into the chair that had been Dumbledore’s.

// 19561
//Harry quietly took one of the chairs around the table, sitting at Minerva’s
//left.

// 19562
//Almost at once, the Floo-fire burned emeraldine and whirled out Alastor Moody,
//who spun around with his wand raised, taking in the whole room at a seeming
//glance, and then pointed his wand directly at Harry and said “Avada Kedavra.”

// 19563
//It happened so fast, and took him so completely by surprise, that Harry’s wand
//wasn’t even half-raised by the time Alastor Moody finished the incantation.

// 19564
//“Just checking,” Alastor said to the Headmistress, whose own wand was now
//pointed at Alastor, her mouth open as if to say words she couldn’t find.
//“Voldie would’ve tried to dodge, if he’d taken over the boy’s body last night.
//I’ll still need to check the Granger girl, though.” Alastor Moody went to
//Minerva’s right and sat down.

// 19565
//Harry had thought, in that split second, to try producing a wordless silver
//Patronus glow from his wand; but his wand hadn’t been in place to intercept in
//time, not even close.

// 19566
//__Well, if I was feeling invincible before, that does for that. What a
//valuable life lesson, Mr. Moody.__

// 19567
//Then the Floo-fire burned green again, and spat out the oldest, grimmest,
//toughest-looking witch Harry had ever seen, like beef jerky given human shape.
//The old witch did not have her wand in her hand, but she projected an air of
//authority that was stronger and stricter than Dumbledore’s.

// 19568
//“This is Director Amelia Bones, Mr. Potter,” said Headmistress McGonagall,
//who’d regained her poise. “We are still waiting on Director Crouch -”

// 19569
//“The corpse of Bartemius Crouch Jr. was identified among the dead Death
//Eaters,” the old witch said without preamble, even as she continued toward the
//chairs. “It took us entirely by surprise, and I’m afraid Bartemius is in
//considerable grief about it, on both counts. He will not be with us today.”

// 19570
//Harry kept the flinch inward.

// 19571
//Amelia Bones sat down in a chair, sitting to Moody’s own right.

// 19572
//“Headmistress McGonagall,” said the elder witch, still without hesitation or
//delay, “The Line of Merlin Unbroken, which Dumbledore left to me in regency, is
//not responding to my hand. The Wizengamot must have a Chief Warlock who is
//trustworthy, __at once;__ matters are in great flux in Britain. I must
//know what Dumbledore has done, immediately!”

// 19573
//“Crap,” muttered Moody. His mad-eye was rolling wildly. “That’s not good, not
//good at all.”

// 19574
//“Yes, well,” said Minerva McGonagall, who looked rather apprehensive. “I cannot
//say that for certain. Albus - well, he clearly had an intimation that he might
//not survive this war. But I do not think he was expecting Miss Granger to come
//back from the dead and kill Voldemort only hours later. I do not think Albus
//was expecting that at all. I am not quite sure what his legacies will make of
//that -”
//! 14%

// 19575
//Amelia Bones rose half out of her chair. “You mean to imply that the
//__Granger__ girl may have inherited the Line of Merlin Unbroken? This is a
//__catastrophe!__ She is twelve years old, untested - surely Albus would
//not be so irresponsible as to leave the Line to whoever happened to defeat
//Voldemort, without knowing __who!”__

// 19576
//“Well, putting it simply,” Minerva said. Her fingers squared the paperwork
//she’d taken with her, now lying on the desk. “Albus __did__ think he knew
//who would defeat Voldemort. There was a prophecy concerning it, a verified one,
//which now seems to be in abeyance, or - I don’t know, Madam Bones! I have one
//letter for Mr. Potter that I am to give him in the event of Albus’s death or
//other departure, and then another letter that Albus said Mr. Potter would be
//able to open only after he defeated Voldemort. I am not sure what will happen
//to it now. Perhaps Miss Granger will be able to open it, or perhaps it can
//never be opened -”

// 19577
//“Hold up,” Mad-Eye Moody said. He reached into his robes, drew out a long,
//grey-knobbed wand that Harry recognized; it was Dumbledore’s wand, of a form
//and style not like any other wand in Hogwarts. Moody laid the wand on the
//table. “Before we go any further, Albus left me an instruction or two of his
//own. Pick up this wand, boy.”

// 19578
//Harry hesitated, thinking.

// 19579
//__Albus Dumbledore sacrificed himself for me. He trusted Moody. This
//probably isn’t a trap.__

// 19580
//Then Harry began to reach for the wand.

// 19581
//It leaped up and flew across the table, into Harry’s hand. And the moment that
//Harry’s fingers grasped the handle it was like he heard a song, a paean of
//glory and battle that resonated in his mind. A wave of white fire ran up the
//handle and over the wood, magnifying as it moved, bursting from the end in a
//tremendous spray of sparks. Through the wood beneath his fingers ran a sense of
//strength and constrained danger, like a leashed wolf.

// 19582
//Harry was also receiving an impression of distinct skepticism, as if the wand
//had some level of awareness, and it was wondering how the hell it had ended up
//being held by a Hogwarts first-year.

// 19583
//“Right,” said Mad-Eye Moody into the puzzled stares. “So it wasn’t Miss Granger
//who defeated Voldie, then. Didn’t think so.”

// 19584
//“What.” Amelia Bones spoke the word flatly.

// 19585
//Mad-Eye Moody gave her a respectful nod. “Albus said this wand goes to whoever
//defeats its previous master. Took it off old Grindie, he did. Then Voldie
//defeated Albus, yesterday. Do I need to spell it out, Amelia?”

// 19586
//Amelia Bones was staring at Harry, her mouth wide open.

// 19587
//“That might not be right,” Harry said. He swallowed another pang of the awful
//guilt. “I mean, Voldemort used me as a hostage because I, I was stupid, and
//Dumbledore gave himself up to save me, maybe the wand thinks that counts as my
//defeating Dumbledore. Um, I did defeat Voldemort, though. Vanquished him. But I
//think it’s better if nobody has any idea I was there.”

// 19588
//Beep. Tick. Whirr. Ding. Poot.

// 19589
//“__That__ must have taken __some__ doing,” Mad-Eye said. The scarred
//man inclined his head slowly, a gesture of profound respect. “Don’t feel too
//guilty about losing Albus and David and Flamel, son, no matter how stupid you
//were. You won in the end. All of us put together never could. Just to check,
//son, you and David also destroyed Voldie’s horcrux? And you’re __certain__
//it was the real thing?”

// 19590
//Harry hesitated, weighing up the probable consequences of trust, the possible
//disasters of silence, and then shook his head to Moody in reply. He’d been
//planning to tell at least McGonagall about what was now inside her school,
//anyway. “Voldemort had… rather a lot of horcruxes, actually. So instead I
//Obliviated most of his memories, then Transfigured him into this.” Harry raised
//his hand, and silently pointed to the emerald on his ring.

// 19591
//Splat. Boing. Splat. Splat.

// 19592
//“Huh,” Moody said, leaning back in his chair. “Minerva and I will be putting
//some alarms and enchantments on that ring of yours, son, if you don’t mind.
//Just in case you forget to sustain that Transfiguration one day. And don’t go
//hunting any other Dark wizards, ever, just live a quiet and peaceful life.” The
//scarred man took a handkerchief and wiped at the beads of sweat that had now
//appeared on his forehead. “But well done, lad, you and David both, may he rest
//in peace. This was his idea, I’m guessing? Well done, I say.”
//! 21%

// 19593
//“Indeed,” said Amelia Bones, who had now regained her composure. “We all owe
//the both of you a tremendous debt of gratitude. But I say again that there is
//urgent business regarding the Line of Merlin Unbroken.”

// 19594
//“I believe,” Minerva McGonagall said slowly, “that I had best give Albus’s
//letters to Mr. Potter, right now.” At the top of her stack of papers now lay a
//parchment envelope, and a rolled-up parchment scroll sealed with a grey ribbon.

// 19595
//The Headmistress gave Harry the parchment envelope, first, and Harry opened it.

// 19597
//__Though it may shock you to learn, this was the end that I wished in my
//heart would come to pass. For as I write this, it yet seems possible that
//Voldemort may fall by my own hand. And then, in time, I shall myself become the
//darkness you must overcome, to enter fully into your power. For it was said
//once that you might need to raise your hand against your mentor, the one who
//made you, who you loved; it was said that you might be my downfall. If you are
//reading this, then that shall never come to pass, and I am glad of it.__

// 19598
//__Even so, Harry, I would spare you this, the lonely fight against
//Voldemort. I write this, vowing to shelter you as long as I can, no matter the
//final cost to myself. But if I have failed, then know that I am glad of it, in
//my own selfish way.__

// 19599
//__With my passing, there is none left to oppose Voldemort as an equal
//save you. His shadow will fall long and terrible over magical Britain, and many
//will suffer and die for it. That shadow will not lift until you destroy its
//source, until you cleanse the heart of the darkness. How you are to do this, I
//do not know. If Voldemort knows not the power you bear, then neither do I. You
//must find that power within yourself, you must learn to wield it, you must
//become Voldemort’s final judge, and I beg you not to make the error of showing
//him mercy.__

//__My wand, which I have left to you in Moody’s keeping, you must not dare

//to the victor in turn. When you have conquered my conqueror, then the wand will
//answer truly to your hand; but if you try to turn it against Voldemort before
//then, it will betray you for certain. Keep it out of Voldemort’s grasp at all
//costs. I should advise you not to wield that wand at all, yet it is a device of
//great power, which you might need in some desperate case. But if you pick it up
//you must fear its treachery at all times.__

// 19601
//__In my absence, the Wizengamot will inevitably fall to Malfoy. The Line
//of Merlin Unbroken I have passed to you, with Amelia Bones as your regent,
//until you come of age or come into your power. But she cannot oppose Malfoy for
//long, not with myself gone and Voldemort returned to advise him. Soon, I think,
//the Ministry will fall, and Hogwarts will become the last fortress. To Minerva
//I have left Hogwarts’s keys, but you alone are its prince, and she will help

//__Alastor now leads the Order of the Phoenix. Heed his words well, both

//Harry folded up the parchment and put its back into the envelope, frowning
//thoughtfully, then took the grey-ribboned scroll from the Headmistress. When

// 19611
//__Dear Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres:__

// 19612
//__If you are reading this, you have defeated Voldemort.__

// 19613
//__Congratulations on that.__

// 19614
//__I hope you had some time in which to celebrate before you opened this
//scroll, because the news in it is not cheerful.__

// 19615
//__During the First Wizarding War, there came a time when I realised that
//Voldemort was winning, that he would soon hold all within his hand.__

// 19616
//__In that extremity, I went into the Department of Mysteries and I
//invoked a password which had never been spoken in the history of the Line of
//Merlin Unbroken, did a thing forbidden and yet not utterly forbidden.__

// 19617
//__I listened to every prophecy that had ever been recorded.__

// 19618
//__And so I learned that my troubles were far worse than Voldemort.__

// 19619
//__From certain seers and diviners have come an increasing chorus of
//foretellings that this world is doomed to destruction.__

// 19620
//__And you, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, are one of those foretold to
//destroy it.__

// 19621
//__By rights I should have ended your line of possibility, stopped you
//from ever being born, as I did my best to end all the other possibilities I
//discovered on that day of terrible awakening.__

// 19622
//__Yet in your case, Harry, and in your case alone, the prophecies of your
//apocalypse have loopholes, though those loopholes be ever so slight.__

// 19623
//__Always ‘he will end the world’, not ‘he will end life’.__

// 19624
//__Even when it was said that you would tear apart the very stars in
//heaven, it was not said that you would tear apart the people.__

// 19625
//__And so, it being clear that this world is not meant to last, I have
//gambled literally everything upon you, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres. There
//were no prophecies of how the world might be saved, so I found the prophecies
//that offered loopholes in the destruction; and I brought about the strange and
//complex conditions for those prophecies to come to pass. I ensured that
//Voldemort discovered a certain one of those prophecies, and so (even as I had
//feared) condemned your parents to death and made you what you are. I wrote a
//strange hint in your mother’s Potions textbook, having no idea why I must; and
//this proved to show Lily how to help her sister, and ensured you would gain
//Petunia Evans’s heartfelt love. I snuck invisibly into your bedroom in Oxford
//and administered the potion that is given to students with Time-Turners, to
//extend your day’s cycle by two hours. When you were six years old I smashed a
//rock that was on your windowsill, and to this day I cannot imagine why.__

// 19626
//__All in the desperate hope that you can pass us through the eye of the
//storm, somehow end this world and yet bring out its people alive.__

// 19627
//__Now that you have passed the preliminary test of defeating Voldemort, I
//place my all in your hands, all the tools I can possibly give you. The Line of
//Merlin Unbroken, the command of the Order of the Phoenix, all my wealth and all
//my treasures, the Elder Wand out of the Deathly Hallows, the loyalty of such of
//my friends as may heed me. I have left Hogwarts in Minerva’s care, for I do not
//think you will have time for it, but even that is yours if you demand it from
//her.__

// 19628
//__One thing I do not give you, and that is the prophecies. Upon the
//moment of my departure, they will be destroyed, and no future ones will be
//recorded, for it was said that you must not look upon them. If you think this
//frustrating, believe me when I say that even your wit cannot comprehend what
//frustration you have been spared. I will die, or be lost by you, or in some
//other way be taken from you - the prophecies are unclear, naturally - without
//ever once knowing what the future truly holds, or why I must do what I do. It
//is all cryptic madness and you are well rid of it.__

// 19629
//__There can only be one king upon the chessboard.__

// 19630
//__There can only be one piece whose value is beyond price.__

// 19631
//__That piece is not the world, it is the world’s peoples, wizard and
//Muggle alike, goblins and house-elves and all.__
//! 35%

// 19632
//__While survives any remnant of our kind, that piece is yet in play,

// 19636
//Harry held the parchment scroll for a long time, staring at nothing.

// 19637
//So.

// 19638
//There were times when the phrase ‘That explains it’ didn’t really seem to cover
//it, but nonetheless, that explained it.

// 19639
//Absently Harry rolled up the parchment scroll in his fist, still staring at
//nothing.

// 19640
//“What does it say?” said Amelia Bones.

// 19641
//“It’s a confession letter,” Harry said. “Turns out Dumbledore’s the one who
//killed my pet rock.”

// 19642
//“__This is not a time for jokes!__” cried the elder witch. “Are you the
//true holder of the Line of Merlin Unbroken?”

// 19643
//“Yes,” Harry said absently, his mind occupied with thoughts that were, by any
//objective quantification, overwhelmingly more important.

// 19644
//The old witch was sitting very still in her chair. She turned her head, and
//locked eyes with Minerva McGonagall.

// 19645
//Meanwhile Harry’s brain, which was juggling way too many possibilities over way
//too many time horizons, some of them involving literally billions of years and
//stellar disassembly procedures, declared cognitive bankruptcy and started over.
//__All right, what’s the __first__ thing I have to do to save the
//world… no, make it even more local, what do I have to do __today…
//__besides figuring out what to do, that is, and I’d better not delay
//before looking at whatever Dumbledore left me in the Phoenix’s Egg room…__

// 19646
//Harry raised his eyes from the rolled-up parchment and looked at Professor- at
//Headmistress McGonagall, at Mad-Eye Moody, and at the leathery-looking old
//witch, as though seeing them for the first time. Though he was in fact seeing
//Amelia Bones for mostly the first time.

// 19647
//Amelia Bones, head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, whom Albus
//Dumbledore had thought worthy to lead the Wizengamot at least temporarily. Her
//cooperation would be invaluable, maybe __necessary,__ for… for whatever
//was headed Harry’s way. Dumbledore had chosen her, and he’d read prophecies
//Harry hadn’t seen.

// 19648
//Amelia Bones, who had thought she’d been appointed regent over the Line of
//Merlin Unbroken and made the next Chief Warlock, only to find that instead the
//position had gone to, apparently, an eleven-year-old boy.

// 19649
//__You will now,__ said the voice of Hufflepuff inside his head,
//__you will now be polite. You will not be your usual brand of bloody
//idiot. Because the fate of the world might just depend on it. Or not. We don’t
//even know.__

// 19650
//“I’m terribly sorry about all this,” Harry Potter said, then paused to see what
//effect, if any, this polite statement had produced.

// 19651
//“Minerva seems to think,” the old witch said, “that you will not take offense
//to honest words.”

// 19652
//Harry nodded. His Ravenclaw part wanted to include the disclaimer about that
//being different from people blatantly trying to push you down while crying that
//you were intolerant of criticism, but Hufflepuff vetoed. Whatever she had to
//say, Harry would hear.

// 19653
//“I do not wish to speak ill of the departed,” the old witch said. “But since
//time immemorial, the Line of Merlin Unbroken has passed to those who
//have__ thoroughly__ demonstrated themselves to be, not only good people,
//but wise enough to distinguish successors who are themselves both good and
//wise. A single break, anywhere along the chain, and the succession might go
//astray and never return! It was a mad act for Dumbledore to pass the Line to
//you at such a young age, even having made it conditional upon your defeat of
//You-Know-Who. A tarnish upon Dumbledore’s legacy, that is how it will be seen.”
//The old witch hesitated, her eyes still watching Harry. “I think it best that
//nobody outside this room ever learn of it.”
//! 43%

// 19654
//“Um,” Harry said. “You… don’t think very much of Dumbledore, I take it?”

// 19655
//“I thought…” said the old witch. “Well. Albus Dumbledore was a better wizard
//than I, a better __person__ than I, in more ways than I can easily count.
//But the man had his faults.”

// 19656
//“Because, um. I mean. Dumbledore __knew__ everything you just said. About
//my being young and how the Line works. You’re acting like you think Dumbledore
//was unaware of those facts, or just ignoring them, when he made his decision.
//It’s true that sometimes stupid people, like me, make decisions that crazy. But
//not Dumbledore. He was __not__ mad.” Harry swallowed, forcing a sudden
//moisture away from his eyes. “I think… I’m beginning to realize… Dumbledore was
//the only sane person, in all of this, all along. The __only__ one who was
//doing the right things for anything like the right reasons…”

// 19657
//Madam Bones was cursing under her breath, low dire imprecations that were
//making Minerva McGonagall twitch.

// 19658
//“I’m sorry,” Harry said helplessly.

// 19659
//Mad-Eye was grinning, the scarred face twisting up in a smile. “Always knew
//Albus was up to __something__ he never told the rest of us. Lad, you have
//no idea how hard it is for me not to use my Eye on that scroll.”

// 19660
//Harry quickly shoved the scroll into his mokeskin pouch.

// 19661
//“Alastor,” Amelia said. The old witch’s voice was rising. “You are a man of
//sense, you cannot think the lad is able to fill Dumbledore’s socks! Not
//__today!__”

// 19662
//“Dumbledore,” Harry said, the name tasting strange on his tongue, “did make one
//wrong assumption, when he made his decisions. He thought we’d be fighting
//Voldemort for years, all of us together. He didn’t know I’d vanquish Voldemort
//immediately. It was the right thing for me to do, it saved a lot of lives
//compared to fighting a long battle. But Dumbledore thought you would have years
//to learn me, trust me… and instead it was all over in an evening.” Harry
//inhaled. “Can’t you just __pretend__ we’ve been fighting Voldemort for
//years and I earned your trust and everything? So that I’m not penalised for
//winning more quickly than Dumbledore expected?”

// 19663
//“You are still a first-year in Hogwarts!” the old witch said. “You
//__cannot__ take Dumbledore’s place, whatever his intentions!”

// 19664
//“Right, that whole ‘looking like an eleven-year-old’ thing.” Harry’s hand came
//up, rubbed at his nose where his glasses lay. __I suppose I could just
//use the Stone, change myself to look like ninety…__

// 19665
//“I am not a fool,” the old witch said. “I know you are no ordinary child. I
//have seen you speak to Lucius Malfoy, watched you frighten off a Dementor, and
//witnessed Fawkes grant your plea. Anyone with wisdom who saw you before the
//Wizengamot - by which I mean myself and at most two others - could guess that
//you had absorbed some portion of You-Know-Who’s shredded soul on the night of
//his undeath, but subdued it and turned his knowledge to good ends.”

// 19666
//There was a slight pause in the room.

// 19667
//“Well, yes, of course,” said Minerva McGonagall. She sighed, slumped a bit in
//the Headmistress’s chair. “As Albus clearly knew __from the very
//beginning,__ but thoughtfully declined to warn me about __in any way
//whatsoever__.”

// 19668
//“Right,” Moody said. “I knew that. Yep. Perfectly obvious. Wasn’t confused at
//all.”

// 19669
//“I guess that’s close enough to the truth,” said Harry. “So, um. What’s the
//problem, exactly?”

// 19670
//“The problem,” Amelia Bones said, her voice perfectly even, “is that you are a
//bubbling, unstable blend of a Hogwarts first-year and You-Know-Who.” She
//paused, as though waiting for something.

// 19671
//“I’m getting better about that,” Harry said, since she seemed to be waiting on
//his reply. “Quite rapidly, in fact. More importantly, it’s not something
//Dumbledore didn’t know.”
//! 49%

// 19672
//The old witch continued. “Giving away your fortune and going in debt to Lucius
//Malfoy to keep your best friend out of Azkaban, as much as it demonstrates your
//upstanding moral character, also demonstrates that you cannot corral the
//Wizengamot. I can see now that you did the right thing for yourself, the thing
//you had to do to maintain your lease on sanity and hold back your inner
//darkness. But you also did a thing that Merlin’s heir must not do. A
//sentimental leader can be far worse than a selfish one. Albus, master and
//servant of a phoenix, was barely survivable - and even he opposed you that
//day.” Amelia gestured in the direction of Mad-Eye Moody. “Alastor has hardness.
//He has cunning. He still does not have the talent for government. You, Harry
//Potter, do not yet have the sternness, the capacity for sacrifice, to direct
//even the Order of the Phoenix. And being what you are, you __must not
//try__ to become that person. Not now, not at your age. Align and fuse your
//divided soul in your own time, if you possibly can. Do not try to be Chief
//Warlock while you are doing it. If Albus thought that was a good idea, he was
//crafting a nicer story at the expense of real-world practicality. I do think
//the man had a problem with that.”

// 19673
//Harry’s eyes were a bit wide, listening to all this. “Um… what exactly do you
//think is going on in here?” Harry tapped his head just above his ear.

// 19674
//“I imagine that inside you is the soul of a boy who remains honest and true,
//gathering his will to force down the fragment of Voldemort’s spirit that tries
//to consume him, even as it howls at him that he is sentimental and weak - did
//you just giggle?”

// 19675
//“Sorry. But seriously, it wasn’t ever __that__ bad. More like having a lot
//of bad habits I needed to break.”

// 19676
//“Ahem,” said Headmistress McGonagall. “Mr. Potter, I think at the start of this
//year it __was__ that bad.”

// 19677
//“Bad habits that chained into and triggered each other. Yes, those are a bit
//more of a problem.” Harry sighed. “And you, Madam Bones… er. Sorry if I’m wrong
//about this. But my guess is that you’re feeling a bit upset that the Line went
//to an eleven-year-old?”

// 19678
//“Not the way you are thinking,” the old witch said calmly. “Though it is
//natural for you to suspect me. The position of Chief Warlock is not one I will
//find pleasant, even compared to the horrors of Magical Law Enforcement. Albus
//persuaded me on the matter, and I would say that I took some convincing, but
//the truth is that I did not waste his time in an argument I expected to lose. I
//knew I would hate the task, and I knew I would do it anyway. Minerva says you
//have some amount of common sense, especially when others remind you of it. Can
//you really see yourself standing upon the Wizengamot’s high dais? Are you sure
//it is not some remnant of You-Know-Who that imagines himself suited to the
//position, or even desires it at all?”

// 19679
//Harry took off his glasses and massaged his forehead. His scar still ached a
//bit, from the damage he’d done by picking at it yesterday until it bled in a
//suitably dramatic fashion. “I do have some common sense, and yes, being Chief
//Warlock sounds like a huge amount of aggravation and a job that, in reality,
//does not fit me the tiniest bit. The trouble is. Um. I’m not sure the Line of
//Merlin is just about being Chief Warlock. There’s, um. I suspect… that there’s
//weird other stuff that goes along with it. And that Dumbledore meant me to take
//responsibility for the… other stuff. And that the other stuff is… possibly
//quite __amazingly__ important.”

// 19680
//“Crap,” Moody said. Then Alastor Moody repeated, “Crap. Kid, should you even be
//saying this to us?”

// 19681
//“I don’t know,” Harry said. “If there’s a user manual, I haven’t looked at it
//yet.”

// 19682
//“Crap.”

// 19683
//“And if these other matters require sternness and sacrifice?” Amelia Bones
//said, still camly. “If they test you as you were tested before the Wizengamot?
//I am old, Harry Potter, and I am not without knowledge of mysteries. You have
//seen how I was able to perceive your own nature at nearly a glance.”

// 19684
//“Amelia,” Mad-Eye Moody said. “What would have happened if you’d had to fight
//You-Know-Who last night?”

// 19685
//The old witch shrugged. “I would have died, I expect.”

// 19686
//“You’d have __lost,__” said Alastor Moody. “And the Boy-Who-Lived didn’t
//just take out Voldie, he set it up so that his good friend Hermione Granger
//came __back from the dead__ at the same time Voldie resurrected himself.
//There’s no way in hell or double hell that was an accident, and I don’t think
//it was David’s idea either. Amy, the truth is, none of us know what the keeper
//of Merlin’s legacy has to __do__. But we’re not the right kind of crazy
//for this crap.”

// 19687
//Amelia Bones frowned. “Alastor, you know I’ve dealt with strange things before.
//Dealt with them quite well, in my opinion.”
//! 56%

// 19688
//“Yeah. You __dealt with__ the crap so you could go back to real life.
//You’re not the kind of crazy that builds a castle out of the crap and lives
//there.” Moody sighed. “Amy, on some level you know exactly why Albus had to
//leave who-knows-what-job to the poor kid.”

// 19689
//The old witch’s fists clenched on the table. “Do you have any idea of the
//__disaster__ it would be for Britain? Call me sane, but I cannot accept
//that outcome! I have worked too long toward this day to see it fall apart now,
//__now__ of all times!”

// 19690
//“Excuse me,” Headmistress McGonagall said, sounding quite precise and Scottish.
//“Is there any reason why Mr. Potter cannot simply instruct the Line that Madam
//Bones is his regent for the position of Chief Warlock, but not anything having
//to do with the Department of Mysteries, until he comes of age? If Albus could
//tell the Line to appoint a regent only until Voldemort’s defeat, it is clearly
//capable of following complex orders.”

// 19691
//Slowly, this unexpected hammer-blow of common sense was absorbed by everyone
//present.

// 19692
//Harry opened his mouth to agree to appoint Amelia Bones his regent for
//Wizengamot-related matters, and then hesitated again.

// 19693
//“Um,” Harry said. “Um. Madam Bones, I would much prefer if you took charge of
//handling the Wizengamot instead of me.”

// 19694
//“In that we are agreed,” said the old witch. “Shall we let it be done?”

// 19695
//“But -”

// 19696
//There was a sort of frustrated dropping-back of the others. “What is the
//problem, Mr. Potter?” said the Headmistress, in a voice that indicated she
//hoped it was nothing serious.

// 19697
//“Um. I think there’s a couple of things I might have to do very soon that
//could… prove politically controversial, and in exchange for handing over the
//Line’s political power to Madam Bones I’m going to want her… um, cooperation on
//some things.”

// 19698
//Amelia Bones exchanged another long stare with Minerva McGonagall. Then she
//looked back at Harry Potter.

// 19699
//“I am indignant at your request!” Amelia Bones said. “Your hesitancy has told
//me that you are weak and unused to bargaining, and will probably fold if I push
//back.”

// 19700
//Harry closed his eyes.

// 19701
//__Slightly__ dark-tinged Harry opened them.

// 19702
//“All right,” Harry said, “let me rephrase. I don’t mean to interfere with your
//work on a day-to-day or even month-to-month basis, but I can’t just toss off
//the final responsibility that Dumbledore left me. I’m not going to owl you
//bizarre parchments out of nowhere, there can be discussions first, but at some
//point I may have to give you an order. If you refuse the order I might have to
//take back the Line’s Wizengamot functions and assume direct control. Can you
//handle that?”

// 19703
//“And if I say no?” said the old witch.

// 19704
//__Slight, slight the dark tinge…__ “I don’t have an alternative to you
//lined up. I could start by asking Augusta Longbottom who she thought might be
//suitable and work from there. But it may be important that we keep to
//Dumbledore’s plan as much as possible, since I don’t know exactly why he did
//the things he did, and he thought Amelia Bones should be Chief Warlock for a
//time. I’m not going to pull Merlin’s name on you, but… no, strike that, I
//__am__ going to pull Merlin’s name on you, this might or might not be
//insanely important.”

// 19705
//The old witch thought for a time, her eyes going from person to person around
//the table. “I am not satisfied with this,” she said after a time. “But the
//Wizengamot must be called to order soon. It will do for now.”

// 19706
//Slowly the old witch reached into her robes, and took out a short rod of stone,
//dark stone.

// 19707
//She placed the rod on the table before Harry. “Take what is yours,” she said.
//“And then do please give it back.”
//! 63%

// 19708
//Harry reached out his hand to take it.

// 19709
//In the moment that Harry’s fingers first touched the dark stone -

// 19710
//- nothing happened.

// 19711
//Well, perhaps Merlin hadn’t been given to melodrama. That could explain why his
//final legacy looked like a small, unassuming dark rod. If that was all that was
//needed for its function, that would be all that was there.

// 19712
//Harry took up the Line, frowning at it. “I’d like to appoint Amelia Bones as my
//regent for Wizengamot-related functions.” Then, the thought occurring to him
//that he needed to specify a stopping point to define a regency, Harry added,
//“Until I say that I’ve taken it back.”

// 19713
//Then Harry made a face. He’d been hoping for more from the Line, but it was
//just a key to places in the Department of Mysteries where interesting things
//were kept, or to seals where Merlin and his successors had stashed things that
//shouldn’t be destroyed but ought to be kept from general circulation. Aside
//from that, the Line didn’t do much.

// 19714
//The Line didn’t let you bypass the Interdict of Merlin either. No, not even if
//the fate of the galaxy was at stake. Not even if the person seemed sane, had
//taken an Unbreakable Vow, and honestly believed the world was about to be
//destroyed otherwise.

// 19715
//Merlin had dreamed of a long run, a world that would last for eons and not just
//centuries. The world had no reason not to last __forever,__ if the truly
//dangerous powers were removed and kept gone. Conversely, a single loophole in
//the safeguards made the world’s destruction only a matter of time. Someday
//Merlin’s Line would pass to the wrong person. It could reject the obviously
//unworthy, but eventually it would pass into hands too subtly flawed for the
//Line to detect. This was inevitable, when dealing with human beings, and Harry
//needed to keep that in mind before he sealed something where future
//Line-holders could retrieve it - the disaster of its inevitable misuse
//__someday__ needed to be outweighed by its benefits over the next few
//thousand years.

// 19716
//Harry let out a sad small sigh, under his breath. __Merlin, you idiot…__

// 19717
//Thinking that didn’t unlock any final safeguards.

// 19718
//There wasn’t anything currently on fire in the Department of Mysteries, so
//Harry carefully placed the Line back on the table.

// 19719
//“Thank you,” the old witch said. She picked up the rod of dark stone. “Do you
//know how I am to use it to call the Wizengamot to order, or - never mind, I
//shall just try striking the podium. That seems obvious enough. To the rest of
//the country, of course, I am the Chief Warlock so far as anyone knows except us
//four.”

// 19720
//Harry hesitated. Then he imagined the owls he would receive if anyone knew he
//was allowed to second-guess the Chief Warlock, and what that would do to
//Amelia’s negotiating power. “Fine.”

// 19721
//Amelia tucked the rod back into her robes. “I will not say it was a pleasure
//doing business with you, Boy-Who-Lived, but it could have been much worse.
//Thank you kindly for that.”

// 19722
//Harry was already feeling worried about the exact balance of power here, from
//the way Madam Bones was acting. The others had, quite logically, deduced that
//it had been mostly David Monroe who’d planned the way to defeating Voldemort,
//which meant they were still underestimating him. It might take a crisis of some
//type, with Harry figuring it out successfully for once instead of screwing up,
//before Amelia Bones started to respect his authority. Or believe in it at all,
//actually… “So,” Harry said. “Any weirdness for me that you would have brought
//to Dumbledore while he was around?”

// 19723
//Amelia looked thoughtful. “Since you ask… I can think of three things, indeed.
//First, we don’t have the faintest notion what ritual was used to sacrifice the
//Death Eaters and resurrect You-Know-Who. It corresponds to no known legend, and
//the magic traces from the ritual have been eradicated. So far as my Aurors can
//tell, everyone’s heads fell off their necks due to natural causes. Except for
//Walden MacNair, who was killed by magical fire after firing a Killing Curse
//from his wand. A very mysterious ritual indeed.” She was giving Harry Potter a
//rather __precise__ look.

// 19724
//Harry considered this, choosing his words carefully. Voldemort had said he’d
//put up wards, so Harry had been confident of not being observed by Time-Turned
//Aurors, but still… “I think this is a matter you don’t need to investigate too
//hard, Madam Bones.”
//! 70%

// 19725
//The old witch grinned slightly. “We can’t be seen to go easy on the
//investigation of so many Noble deaths, Harry Potter. When I heard retold your
//particular account of David’s last stand, I made certain to send investigators
//whom I considered __reliable__ in the usual quality of their work. Auror
//Nobbs and Auror Colon, in fact, who are widely respected outside my Department.
//I found their report to be quite fascinating reading.” Amelia paused. “There’s
//a possibility that Augustus Rookwood left a ghost -”

// 19726
//“Exorcise it before anyone talks to it,” Harry said, conscious of the sudden
//hammering of his heart.

// 19727
//“Yes, sir,” the old witch said dryly. “I shall disrupt the soul’s anchoring a
//little, and none shall be the wiser when it fails to materialize. The second
//matter is that there was a still-living human arm found among the Dark Lord’s
//things -”

// 19728
//“Bellatrix,” Harry said. His mind had leaped back, made the connection that
//ongoing trauma had blurred. “I think that’s Bellatrix Black’s arm.”
//__Lesath Lestrange hadn’t been named as someone who’d lost a parent.__
//“Oh, bloody hell. She’s still out there, isn’t she. Can you use her arm to
//track her down somehow?”

// 19729
//Amelia Bones had acquired a sour look. “I see. As I was saying, a still-living
//human arm was found among the Dark Lord’s things, but it proved to be easily
//incinerated.”

// 19730
//“What __idiot__ -” Harry stopped himself. “No, __not__ an idiot.
//Because immediately destroying Dark objects is Department policy. Because of
//past experiences with rings that really should’ve been dropped into volcanos
//immediately. Right?”

// 19731
//Moody and Amelia nodded in unison. “Good guess, son,” said Moody.

// 19732
//It might seem literarily inevitable that Harry’s past stupidity was going to
//come back and haunt him in some horrible fashion later, but that was no reason
//not to try subverting the plot. “I expect you’ve thought of this already,”
//Harry said, “but the obvious next step is to put out your equivalent of an
//international bulletin for a thin witch missing her left arm. Oh, and add
//twenty-five thousand Galleons pledged from me - Headmistress, it’s fine, please
//trust me on this - to whatever reward is being offered.”

// 19733
//“Well said.” The old witch leaned forward slightly. “The third and final
//matter… there was one truly puzzling element to last night’s events, and I am
//curious to see what you make of it, Harry Potter. Found among the corpses was
//the head and the body of Sirius Black.”

// 19734
//“__What?__” yelled Moody, starting half from his chair. __“I thought
//he was in Azkaban!”__

// 19735
//“So he is,” said Madam Bones. “We checked that at once. The Azkaban guards
//reported that Sirius Black was still in his cell. Black’s head and body have
//been transported to the St. Mungo’s morgue, and show the same cause of death as
//the other Death Eaters, that is to say, his head spontaneously fell off. I am
//also told that Sirius Black is, as of this morning, sitting in the corner of
//his cell rocking back and forth with his head between his hands. No other
//duplicate Death Eaters have been found. Yet.”

// 19736
//There was a pause filled with ticking and whooping things, as people considered
//this.

// 19737
//“Ah…” said Minerva. “That’s not possible even by You-Know-Who’s standards of
//possibility. Is it?”

// 19738
//“I would have thought so too when I was your age, dear,” said Amelia. “It is
//the sixth strangest thing I have ever seen.”

// 19739
//“You see, son?” said Moody. “This sort of thing is why nobody, even me, can
//ever be paranoid enough.” The scarred man tilted his head, looking thoughtful,
//as his bright blue eye kept ever-roving. “Twin brother, concealed from the rest
//of the world? Walpurga Black gave birth to twins, couldn’t bear to kill one,
//knew old Pollux would demand it… nah, ain’t buyin’ it.”

// 19740
//“Any ideas, Mr. Potter?” said Amelia Bones. “Or is this another matter into
//which my Department should not inquire too closely?”

// 19741
//Harry closed his eyes and thought.

// 19742
//Sirus Black had hunted down Peter Pettigrew, instead of fleeing the country as
//common sense would have suggested.

// 19743
//Black had been found in the middle of the street, surrounded by bodies,
//laughing.

// 19744
//Nothing left of Pettigrew except one finger.
//! 77%

// 19745
//Pettigrew had been a spy for the Light, not a double agent but somebody who
//snuck around and found things out.

// 19746
//One of the conspiracy theories about Pettigrew had been that he was an
//Animagus, since he’d been good at ferreting out secrets even in his Hogwarts
//years.

// 19747
//Dementors sapped all the magic in their vicinity.

// 19748
//Professor Quirrell had said something about a particular type of magic that
//rearranged flesh like a Muggle smith reshaping metal with hammer and tongs…

// 19749
//Harry opened his eyes again.

// 19750
//“Was Peter Pettigrew a secret Metamorphmagus?”

// 19751
//Amelia Bones’s face changed. She made a single croaking noise and fell backward
//within her chair.

// 19752
//“Yes, in fact…” Minerva said slowly. “Why?”

// 19753
//“Sirius Black Confunded Peter Pettigrew,” Harry’s voice explained patiently,
//“to force him to change shape and pretend to be Black. By the time the
//Confundus wore off, Peter was in Azkaban and couldn’t change back. The Aurors
//are used to people in Azkaban saying absolutely anything to get out, so they
//didn’t listen while Peter Pettigrew was screaming about it over and over again
//until his voice wore out.”

// 19754
//Even Mad-Eye Moody’s face showed the horror, then.

// 19755
//“In retrospect,” said Harry’s voice, which seemed to be operating entirely on
//automatic, “you should have been suspicious when you managed to get that
//__one__ Death Eater hauled off to Azkaban without a trial.”

// 19756
//“We thought Malfoy was distracted,” whispered the old witch. “That he was only
//trying to save himself. There were other Death Eaters we managed to get then,
//like Bellatrix -”

// 19757
//Harry nodded, feeling like his neck and head were moving on puppet strings.
//“The Dark Lord’s most fanatic and devoted servant, a natural nucleus of
//opposition for anyone who contested Lucius’s control of the Death Eaters. You
//thought Lucius was distracted.”

// 19758
//“Get him out of there,” said Minerva McGonagall. Her voice rose to a scream.
//“__Get him out of there!__”

// 19759
//Amelia Bones shoved herself up from the chair, whirled on the Floo -

// 19760
//“Stop.”

// 19761
//Everyone looked at Harry with astonishment, none more than Minerva McGonagall.

// 19762
//Something else seemed to have taken over Harry’s voice. “There’s four things we
//still need to discuss. An innocent man has been in Azkaban for ten years, eight
//months, and fourteen days. He can stay there a few minutes longer. That’s how
//urgent those four things are.”

// 19763
//“You -” whispered Amelia Bones. “You should not try to be this person, at your
//age -”

// 19764
//“First. I think I should look at the complete police records on every other
//Death Eater that went to Azkaban __while Lucius was distracted.__ Can you
//compile that by tonight?”

// 19765
//“Within the hour,” said Amelia Bones. She looked gray.

// 19766
//Harry nodded. “Second. Azkaban is over. You’ll need to start preparations now
//to move the prisoners to Nurmengard or other secure non-Dementor prisons, and
//to provide treatment for their Dementor exposure.”

// 19767
//“I,” said Amelia. The old witch seemed bent, diminished. “I… do not think, that
//even with this… scandal, that the remainder of the Wizengamot will bend… and
//the Dementors must be fed, not so much as we have fed them, but they must be
//given some victims, or they will roam the world, prey on innocents…”
//! 84%

// 19768
//“It doesn’t matter what the Wizengamot says,” Harry said. “Because -” Harry’s
//voice choked. “Because -” Harry took a deep breath, steadied himself. He
//thought he could see the shape now of the immediate future, could see it
//stretching out before him like a golden pathway lit with sunlight. __Was
//this also written, in the book of Time that I must not see? __“Because if I’m
//right about what comes next, then sometime very soon, Hermione Granger, the
//Girl-Who-Revived, is going to go to Azkaban and destroy all the Dementors
//there.”

// 19769
//“Impossible!” spat Mad-Eye Moody.

// 19770
//“Merlin,” whispered Amelia Bones. “Oh, dear Merlin. That’s what happened to the
//Dementor that Dumbledore ‘lost’. That’s why they’re afraid of you - and now her
//as well?” Her voice trembled. “What is this, what is all this?”

// 19771
//__If Hermione believes that Death can be defeated -__

// 19772
//__Whether or not she could’ve believed that before, she’ll believe it
//now.__

// 19773
//“An authorized portkey to Azkaban would be appreciated -” Harry’s voice broke
//again. Tears were streaming down his cheeks.

// 19774
//__She can’t die. I have her horcrux.__

// 19775
//__But Hermione doesn’t need to know about that. Not for one more week.__

// 19776
//__If she’s willing to risk her own life to end this -__

// 19777
//“Though I think, she might make, her own way there…”

// 19778
//“Harry?” said Headmistress McGonagall.

// 19779
//Harry was crying now, huge ragged breaths bursting from him. But he didn’t stop
//talking. Somewhere out there Peter Pettigrew was waiting while Harry cried.

// 19780
//Somewhere out there, everyone was waiting while he cried.

// 19781
//“Third. Somewhere just inside the wards of Hogwarts. In a highly defensible
//position. But where emergency cases can be portkeyed in from just outside the
//wards. There’s going to be a high-security h-h-hospital. With very powerful
//guards, that have taken Unbreakable Vows, I don’t, I don’t care how much gold
//it takes to pay for the Vows, it genuinely does not matter any more. And, and
//Alastor Moody is going to design the security architecture, and go completely
//overboard on paranoia without being constrained by a budget or sanity or common
//sense, only it has to open __soon.__” Couldn’t stop talking to cry.

// 19782
//“Harry,” said the Headmistress, “both of them think you’ve gone mad, they don’t
//know you well enough to know better. You need to slow down and explain.”

// 19783
//Instead Harry reached into his pouch and made sign language with his fingers,
//and lifted out, his fingers straining, a five-kilo chunk of gold larger than
//his fist, from when he’d been experimenting this morning. It made a heavy thud
//as it landed on the table.

// 19784
//Moody reached over and tapped it with his wand, and then his throat made an
//incomprehensible sound.

// 19785
//“That’s your starting budget, Alastor, if you need money right away. Nicholas
//Flamel didn’t make the Philosopher’s Stone, he stole it, Dumbledore didn’t know
//the secret history but Monroe did. Once you know how it works, the Stone can do
//one complete restoration to full health and youth every two hundred and
//thirty-four seconds. Three hundred sixty people per day. One hundred and
//thirty-four thousand healings per year. That should be enough to stop, all the
//wizards everywhere, and all the goblins and house-elves and whoever, from
//dying. Of old age, or anything else.” Harry was wiping away tears, over and
//over. “Flamel had more blood on his hands than a hundred Voldemorts, for all
//the people he could’ve saved and didn’t. The whole time, Moody, the
//Philosopher’s Stone could’ve healed all your scars and given you back your leg,
//any time Flamel felt like it. Dumbledore didn’t know. I’m sure he didn’t know.”
//Harry smiled shakily. “I can’t imagine you as a teenage witch, Madam Bones, but
//I bet it looks good on you. That’ll give you more energy for trying to keep the
//Wizengamot from messing with me, because if they get the idea that the Stone is
//something they can mess with in any way, tax, regulate, I don’t care, Hogwarts
//is going to secede from Britain and become its own country. Headmistress,
//Hogwarts is no longer dependent on the Ministry for gold, or for that matter
//food. You may reform the educational curriculum at will. I’m thinking we may
//want to add some more advanced courses soon, especially in Muggle studies.”

// 19786
//“Slow __down!__” said Minerva McGonagall.

// 19787
//“Fourth -” Harry said, and then stopped.
//! 91%

// 19788
//__Fourth. Begin preparations for an orderly take-down of the Statute of
//Secrecy and to provide magical healing on a mass scale to the Muggle world.
//Those who oppose this agenda in any way may be denied services by the Stone…__

// 19789
//Harry’s lips couldn’t move. Not wouldn’t, __couldn’t.__

// 19790
//With six billion Muggles thinking creatively about how to use magic…

// 19791
//Transfiguring antimatter was just one idea. It wasn’t even the most destructive
//idea. There were also black holes and negatively charged strangelets. And if
//black holes couldn’t be Transfigured because they didn’t __already exist__
//as magic defined that to within some spatial radius, there was just
//Transfiguring lots and lots of nuclear weapons and Black Death plague that
//could reproduce before the Transfiguration wore off and Harry hadn’t even
//thought about the problem for five minutes but it didn’t matter because he’d
//already thought of enough. Someone would think of it, someone would talk,
//someone would try it. The probability was as close to certainty as made no
//difference.

// 19792
//What happened if you Transfigured a cubic millimeter of up quarks, just the up
//quarks without any down quarks to bind them? Harry didn’t even know, and up
//quarks were certainly a kind of substance that already existed. All it might
//take was one single Muggleborn who knew the names of the six quarks deciding to
//try it. That could __be__ the clock ticking down to the prophesied end of
//the world.

// 19793
//Harry would have tried to deny the thought, rationalize it away.

// 19794
//He couldn’t do that either.

// 19795
//It wasn’t a thing-Harry-Potter-would-do.

// 19796
//Like water flowing downhill, Harry Potter would take no chances when it came to
//not destroying the world.

// 19797
//“Fourth?” said Amelia Bones, who was looking like she’d been hit repeatedly in
//the face with a planet. “__What comes fourth?__”

// 19798
//“Never mind,” said Harry. His voice did not break. He did not fold over
//sobbing. There were still lives he could save and those took precedence. “Never
//mind. Chief Warlock Bones, I’ve given the regency of the Wizengamot into your
//hands. Please use that position to announce internationally that the Stone’s
//healing power will soon be made available to all, and that meanwhile, all dying
//patients are to be kept alive at any cost, no matter what magic is required to
//do it. That announcement is your absolute priority. When you have done that you
//may rescue Peter Pettigrew and tell your old Department to begin preparations
//for shutting down Azkaban. Then please have someone prepare a full list of
//imprisoned Death Eaters and what was said at their trials and whether Lucius
//seemed strangely uninterested in defending them. Thank you. That’s all.”

// 19799
//Amelia Bones turned without another word, and dashed into the Floo like it was
//her own self that was on fire.

// 19800
//“And someone,” Harry said, his voice breaking again now that it was all set in
//motion, and crying wasn’t costing time, though the vast majority of total lives
//at stake had turned out not to be savable just yet, “someone has to, someone
//tell Remus Lupin.”
