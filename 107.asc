//== The Truth, Pt 4

// 18213
//The spiraling leaves of the gigantic dieffenbachia felt like forest loam
//beneath Harry’s shoes, not as unyielding as concrete, but supporting his
//weight. Harry kept a wary eye on the tendrils, but they remained passive.

// 18214
//When Harry reached the bottom of the leafy spiral staircase, the tendrils
//suddenly whipped out and grasped Harry’s arms and legs.

// 18215
//After a brief struggle, Harry allowed himself to go limp.

// 18216
//“Interesting,” said Professor Quirrell, as he floated down from above, not
//touching any of the plant’s leaves or tendrils. “I notice that you seem to have
//no trouble losing to a plant.”

// 18217
//Harry looked more closely at the Defense Professor, seeing him now without the
//lens of panic. Professor Quirrell was upright and moving, flying without
//apparent difficulty; the sense of doom about him was strong. But his eyes were
//still sunken in the skull, his arms thin and wasted. The sickness had
//__not__ been bluff, and the obvious hypothesis was that the Defense
//Professor had recently eaten another unicorn to temporarily regain some
//strength.

// 18218
//And the Defense Professor was also speaking like the mask of Professor
//Quirrell, not like Lord Voldemort, which might not be a bad thing from Harry’s
//perspective. Harry didn’t know why - unless it was that the Defense Professor
//still needed him for something - but it certainly seemed to be in Harry’s own
//interests to play along.

// 18219
//“You specifically let me walk into this trap, Professor,” Harry answered, just
//the way he’d have spoken to Professor Quirrell. __Roles, masks, remind
//him of how it was between us…__ “On my own, I’d have used my broomstick.”

// 18220
//“Perhaps. How would an ordinary first-year solve this challenge? If they had
//their wand, that is.” The plant was now reaching tendrils out toward Professor
//Quirrell, but Professor Quirrell was hovering just out of their reach.

// 18221
//Harry had now remembered Professor Sprout talking about a Devil’s Snare plant,
//which the Herbology textbook had said liked cool, dark places like caves -
//though how that could be true of a leafy plant was anyone’s guess. “At a guess,
//I’d say this is a Devil’s Snare plant and it might retreat from light or heat.
//So maybe a first-year could use Lumos? Today I’d use __Inflammare__, but I
//didn’t learn that spell until May.”

// 18222
//A twirl of the Defense Professor’s wand, and a pattern of sprays of liquid shot
//out from it, striking the plant near the bases of its tendrils, hitting with a
//quiet splat and then a quiet hissing. All the tendrils touching Harry
//frantically shot back and began to beat at the growing wounds appearing on the
//plant’s skin, as if trying to remove the pain-stimulus; something about the
//plant gave the impression that it was screaming soundlessly.

// 18223
//Professor Quirrell finished drifting downward. “Now it is afraid of light,
//heat, acid, and me.”

// 18224
//Harry stepped off the final leaves onto the floor, after a careful glance at
//his robes and then the floor to make sure that none of the acid had splashed
//anywhere. Harry had begun to suspect that Professor Quirrell was trying to make
//some sort of point, but Harry did not know what that point might be. “I thought
//we were on a mission, Professor. I can’t stop you, but is it __smart__ to
//spend this much time on messing with me?”

// 18225
//“Oh, we have time,” said Professor Quirrell, sounding amused. “There would be a
//great uproar if we were discovered here, guarded by an Inferius. You did not
//act like you had heard of such an uproar at your Quidditch match, before you
//arrived in this time and spoke to Snape as you did.”

// 18226
//A slight chill came over Harry, as he comprehended this. Anything he did to
//beat Professor Quirrell would have to __not__ disrupt the school, or at
//least the Quidditch game, because it __hadn’t__ disrupted the Quidditch
//game. Even if enough forces could be called in to subdue Lord Voldemort, it
//might not be easy to do it without Professor McGonagall or Professor Flitwick
//or anyone else at the Quidditch game noticing…

// 18227
//Fighting a smart enemy was hard.

// 18228
//And even so… even so it seemed to Harry that if he stood in Professor
//Quirrell’s shoes, he would not be having leisurely conversations and playing
//mind games. Professor Quirrell was gaining __something __by taking his
//time here. But what? Was there some other process that had to run to
//completion?

// 18229
//“By the by, have you betrayed me yet?” said Professor Quirrell.

// 18230
//__“Have not betrayed you yet,__” Harry hissed.

// 18231
//The Defense Professor gestured pointedly with the gun he was now holding in his
//left hand, and Harry walked ahead to the great wooden door at the end of the
//room, and opened it.

// 18232
//The next chamber was smaller in diameter, with a higher ceiling. The light
//shining out of the arched alcoves was white, instead of blue.

// 18233
//Around them whizzed hundreds of winged keys, beating frantically through the
//air. After watching for a few seconds, it became clear that only a single key
//was the golden color of a Snitch - though it was moving slower than a Snitch in
//a real Quidditch game.

// 18234
//On the other end of the room was a door containing a large, prominent keyhole.

// 18235
//Against the left wall leaned a broomstick, the school’s workhorse Cleansweep
//Seven.

// 18236
//“Professor,” Harry said, staring up at the clouds and flocks of whizzing keys,
//“you said you would answer my questions. What exactly is all this about? If you
//think you’ve secured a door so that it won’t open without a key, you keep the
//key in a safe place and only give a copy to authorized entrants. You don’t
//__give the key wings__ and then __leave a broomstick propped against
//the wall.__ So what the heck are we doing in here and what is going on? It’s an
//obvious guess that the magic mirror is the only real factor guarding the Stone,
//but why the rest of this - and why encourage first-years to come here?”

// 18237
//“I am truly not sure,” said the Defense Professor. He had entered the room and
//taken up station well to Harry’s right, maintaining the distance between them.
//“But I shall answer, as I said I would. Dumbledore’s way is to do a dozen
//things which seem mad, and then only eight of them, or perhaps nine, conceal an
//inner meaning. My guess is that Dumbledore intends to make it seem like I am
//invited to send a student as my proxy. Precisely so that Lord Voldemort, as
//Dumbledore conceives of him, is less tempted to think himself clever by doing
//so. Imagine Dumbledore first considering the issue of how to ward the Stone.
//Imagine Dumbledore considering whether to set true dangers to guard the Mirror.
//Imagine him imagining some young student blundering through those dangers at my
//behest. I think that is what Dumbledore is trying to avoid, by making it seem
//as though that strategy is invited, and so not cunning. Unless, of course, I
//have misunderstood what Dumbledore thinks Lord Voldemort will think.” Professor
//Quirrell grinned, and it looked just as natural, on him, as any grin he’d shown
//Harry before. “Plotting does not come naturally to Dumbledore, but he tries
//because he must. To that task Dumbledore brings intelligence, dedication, the
//ability to learn from his mistakes, and an utter lack of native talent. He is
//marvelously hard to predict for that reason alone.”

// 18238
//Harry turned away, looking at the door on the opposite side of the room.
//__It wasn’t a game to him, Professor. __“My guess is that the intended
//solution for first-years is to ignore the broomstick and use __Wingardium
//Leviosa__ to grab the key, since this isn’t a Quidditch game and there are no
//rules forbidding that. So what absurdly overpowered spell are you going to
//unleash on this one, then?”

// 18239
//There was a brief silence but for the whizzing of keys.

// 18240
//Harry took several steps away from Professor Quirrell. “I probably shouldn’t
//have said that, should I.”

// 18241
//“Oh, no,” Professor Quirrell said. “I think that is a quite reasonable thing to
//say to the most powerful Dark Wizard in the world when he is standing not a
//dozen paces from you.”

// 18242
//Professor Quirrell put his wand back into the sleeve of his other hand, the
//hand that sometimes held the gun.

// 18243
//Then the Defense Professor reached into his mouth and took out what appeared to
//be a tooth. He tossed the false tooth high in the air, and when it came down,
//it had transformed into a wand that sparked a strange sense of recognition in
//Harry’s mind, as though some part of him recognized that wand as being… part of
//him…

// 18244
//__Thirteen and a half inches, yew, with a core of phoenix feather.__ Harry
//had memorized the information when the wandmaker Olli-something had given it,
//because it had seemed like it might be Plot-Relevant. The event, and the
//thinking that had underlain it, both felt a lifetime distant.

// 18245
//The Defense Professor raised that wand, and traced in the air a flaming rune
//that was all jagged edges and malevolence; Harry took another instinctive step
//back. Then Professor Quirrell spoke. “Az-reth. Az-reth. Az-reth.”

// 18246
//The flaming rune began pouring out fire that was… __twisted,__ as though
//the jagged edges of the rune had become the nature of the fire itself. The fire
//was blazing crimson, shaded further red than blood, glowing as searingly
//intense as an arc-welder. That brilliance in that shade seemed __wrong__
//in its own right, like nothing shaded so far red should give off that much
//light; and the searing crimson was shot through with veins of black that seemed
//to suck the light from the fire. Within the blackened fire, outlined in the
//interplay of crimson and darkness, animal shapes twisted wildly from one
//predator to another, cobra to hyena to scorpion.

// 18247
//“Az-reth. Az-reth. Az-reth.” When Professor Quirrell had repeated the word six
//times, as much black-crimson fire had poured out as the volume of a small bush.

// 18248
//The cursed fire slowed in its changes as Professor Quirrell locked eyes upon
//it, taking on a single form, the form of a blackened blood-burning phoenix.

// 18249
//And something told Harry with a terrible certainty that if that black burning
//phoenix met Fawkes, the true phoenix would die and never be reborn.

// 18250
//Professor Quirrell made a single gesture with his wand, and the blackened fire
//went soaring across the room. It met the door and its keyhole, and with a
//single sweep of crimson-burning wings, most of the door and part of the archway
//was consumed. Then the tainted crimson blaze swept on.

// 18251
//Harry had only a glance through the hole to see huge statues just beginning to
//raise swords and clubs, when the blackened fire came among them, and they
//cracked and burned.

// 18252
//When it ended, the blackened-fire phoenix swept back in through the hole, and
//hovered above Professor Quirrell’s left shoulder, the sun-intense crimson claws
//staying an inch from his robes.

// 18253
//“Go on ahead,” said Professor Quirrell. “It’s safe now.”

// 18254
//Harry walked forward, needing to invoke his dark side’s cognitive patterns in
//order to maintain calm enough to do it. Harry stepped over the glowing edges of
//the remaining part of the door, and gazed at a chessboard of ruined huge
//chess-pieces. The alternating tiles of black and white marble on the floor
//started five meters after the ruined doorway, and extended from wall to wall,
//but stopped five meters short of the next door on the opposite side of the
//room. The ceiling was significantly higher than any of the statues should have
//been able to reach.

// 18255
//“I would guess,” Harry said, and his dark side’s cognitive patterns kept his
//voice calm, “that the intended solution is to fly over the statues using the
//broomstick from the previous room, since it wasn’t actually needed to get the
//key?”

// 18256
//From behind, Professor Quirrell laughed, and it was Lord Voldemort’s laugh.
//“Proceed,” said a voice grown colder and higher. “Go to the next room. I wish
//to see what you will make of what is there.”

// 18257
//__Arranged by Dumbledore for first-years,__ Harry reminded himself,
//__it WILL be safe,__ and he walked across the ruined chessboard, laid his
//hand upon that door’s handle, and pushed it inward.

// 18258
//Half a second later, Harry slammed the door and leapt back.

// 18259
//It took Harry several seconds to master his breathing, and master himself. From
//behind the door came continued loud bellows, and great slams as of a rock club
//pounding the floor.

// 18260
//“I suppose,” Harry said in a voice grown cold as well, “that since Dumbledore
//would hardly put a real mountain troll in there, the next challenge is an
//illusion of my worst memories. Like a Dementor, with the memory projected into
//the outside world. Very amusing, Professor.”

// 18261
//Professor Quirrell advanced himself toward the door, and Harry stepped well
//aside. Besides the sense of doom that was now strong about the Professor,
//Harry’s dark side or just plain instinct was advising him not to get anywhere
//near that black-crimson fire hovering above Professor Quirrell’s shoulder.

// 18262
//Professor Quirrell swung open the door, and looked in. “Hm,” Professor Quirrell
//said. “Just the troll, as you say. Ah, well. I had hoped to learn something
//about you more interesting than that. What lies within is a
//Kokorhekkus__,__ also known as the common boggart.”

// 18263
//“A boggart? What does that - no, I suppose I know what it does.”

// 18264
//“A boggart,” Professor Quirrell said, and now his voice was again that of a
//Hogwarts Professor lecturing, “gravitates to dark enclosures that are rarely
//opened, such as a neglected cupboard in the attic. It seeks to be left alone,
//and it will manifest in whatever form it thinks will scare you away.”

// 18265
//“Scare me away?” Harry said. “I __killed__ the troll.”

// 18266
//“You leapt backward out of the room without thinking. A boggart seeks out the
//instinctive flinch, not the reasoned threat. Else it would have selected
//something more believable. In any case, the standard counter-Charm for a
//boggart is, of course, Fiendfyre.” Professor Quirrell gestured, and the
//blackened fire leapt off his shoulder and poured through the doorway.

// 18267
//From within the room there was a single squeak, and then nothing.

// 18268
//They advanced into the boggart’s former room, Professor Quirrell going first
//this time. With the seeming mountain troll gone, the room was just another huge
//chamber lit by sconces of cold blue light.

// 18269
//Professor Quirrell’s gaze seemed distant, thoughtful. He crossed the room
//without waiting for Harry, and swung open the door on the opposite wall of his
//own accord.

// 18270
//Harry followed after, and not closely.

// 18271
//The next chamber contained a cauldron, a rack of bottled ingredients, chopping
//boards, stirring sticks, and the other apparatus of Potions. The light coming
//from the arched alcoves was white instead of blue, presumably because color
//vision was important to Potions-brewing. Professor Quirrell was already
//standing next to the brewing apparatus, scrutinizing a long parchment he had
//picked up. The door to the next chamber was guarded by a curtain of purple fire
//that would have looked a lot more threatening, if it hadn’t seemed pale and
//weak by comparison to the blackened flame hovering over Professor Quirrell’s
//shoulder__.__

// 18272
//Harry’s suspension of disbelief had already checked out on vacation at this
//point, so he didn’t say anything about how real-world security systems had the
//goal of __distinguishing__ authorized from unauthorized personnel, which
//meant issuing challenges that behaved __differently__ around people who
//were or weren’t supposed to be there. For example, a __good__ security
//challenge would be testing whether the entrant knew a lock combination that
//only authorized people had been told, and a __bad__ security challenge
//would be testing whether the entrant could brew a potion according to written
//instructions that had been helpfully included.

// 18273
//Professor Quirrell tossed the parchment toward Harry, and it fluttured to the
//ground between them. “What do you make of this?” said Professor Quirrell, who
//then stepped back so that Harry could come forward and pick up the parchment.

// 18274
//“Nope,” Harry said after skimming the parchment. “Testing whether the entrant
//can solve a ridiculously straightforward logic puzzle about the order of the
//ingredients is still not a challenge that behaves differently for authorized
//and unauthorized personnel. It doesn’t matter if you use a more interesting
//logic puzzle about three idols or a line of people wearing colored hats, you’re
//still completely missing the point.”

// 18275
//“Look at the other side,” said Professor Quirrell.

// 18276
//Harry turned over the two-foot parchment.

// 18277
//On the other side, written in tiny letters, was the __longest__ list of
//brewing instructions Harry had ever seen. “What on Earth-”

// 18278
//“A __potion of effulgence,__ to quench the purple fire,” Professor
//Quirrell said. “It is made by adding the same ingredients, over and over again,
//in slightly different ways. Imagine some eager young group of first-years,
//passing all the other chambers, thinking they are just about to reach the magic
//mirror, and then encountering this task. This room is the handiwork of the
//Potions Master indeed.”

// 18279
//Harry glanced pointedly at the blackfire shape on Professor Quirrell’s
//shoulder. “Fire can’t beat fire?”

// 18280
//“It can,” said Professor Quirrell. “I am not sure it should. Suppose this room
//is trapped?”

// 18281
//Harry did __not__ want to be stuck brewing this potion for laughs, or for
//whatever other reason Professor Quirrell was taking them through these chambers
//so slowly. The potions recipe had __thirty-five __separate occasions for
//adding bellflowers, fourteen times to add ‘a lock of bright hair’… “Maybe the
//potion gives off a lethal gas that is fatal to adult wizards but not children.
//Or any of a hundred other deadly tricks, if we’re suddenly being serious. Are
//we being serious?”

// 18282
//“This room is the handiwork of Severus Snape,” Professor Quirrell said, once
//more looking thoughtful. “Snape is not a bystander in this game, not quite. He
//lacks Dumbledore’s intelligence, but possesses the killing intent that
//Dumbledore never had.”

// 18283
//“Well, whatever’s going on here, it doesn’t actually keep out children,” Harry
//observed. “Lots of first-years made it through. And if you can somehow keep out
//everyone __except__ children, then that, from Dumbledore’s perspective,
//forces Lord Voldemort to possess a child to enter. I don’t see the point, given
//their goals.”

// 18284
//“Indeed,” Professor Quirrell said, rubbing the bridge of his nose. “But see,
//boy, this room lacks the triggers and tripsigns that are upon the others. There
//are no subtle wards to be defeated. It is as if I am __invited__ to bypass
//the Potion and simply enter - but Snape knows that Lord Voldemort will perceive
//this. If in fact there was a trap laid for anyone who did not brew the potion,
//then it would be wiser to lay wards, and give no sign that this room was
//different from the others.”

// 18285
//Harry listened, frowning in concentration. “So… the only point of leaving off
//the detection webs is to make you __not__ bulldoze this room.”

// 18286
//“I expect Snape expects me to deduce that as well,” the Defense Professor said.
//“And past that point I cannot predict at what level he thinks I will play. I am
//patient, and I have given myself plenty of time for this endeavor. But Snape
//does not know me, he only knows Lord Voldemort. He has sometimes seen Lord
//Voldemort shriek in frustration, and act on impulses that appear
//counterproductive. Consider this matter from Snape’s perspective: it is the
//Potions Master of Hogwarts telling Lord Voldemort to be patient and follow
//instructions if he wants to enter, as though Lord Voldemort were a mere
//schoolboy. I would find it easy to comply, smiling the while, and take my
//vengeance later. But Snape does not know that Lord Voldemort finds it easy to
//think this way.” Professor Quirrell looked at Harry. “Boy, you saw me floating
//in the air by the Devil’s Snare, did you not?”

// 18287
//Harry nodded. Then he noticed his confusion. “My Charms textbook says that it’s
//impossible for wizards to levitate themselves.”

// 18288
//“Yes,” said Professor Quirrell, “that is what it says in your Charms textbook.
//No wizard may levitate themselves, or any object supporting their own weight;
//it is like trying to lift yourself up by your own bootstraps. Yet Lord
//Voldemort alone can fly - how? Answer as quickly as you can.”

// 18289
//If the question was answerable by a first-year student - “You had someone else
//cast broomstick enchantments on your underwear, then you Obliviated them.”

// 18290
//“Not quite,” said Professor Quirrell. “The broomstick enchantments require a
//long narrow shape, which must be solid. Cloth will not do.”

// 18291
//Harry’s eyebrows furrowed. “How long does the shape have to be? Can you attach
//some short broomstick rods to a fabric harness, and fly using those?”

// 18292
//“Indeed, at first I strapped enchanted rods to my arms and legs, but that was
//only to teach myself a new mode of flight.” Professor Quirrell drew back the
//sleeve of his robes, revealing the bare arm. “As you can see, I have nothing up
//my sleeve right now.”

// 18293
//Harry absorbed this further constraint. “You had someone cast broomstick
//enchantments on your __bones?__”

// 18294
//Professor Quirrell sighed. “And that was one of Voldemort’s most feared feats,
//or so I am told. After all these years, and some amount of reluctant
//Legilimency, I still do not truly comprehend what is __wrong__ with
//ordinary people… But you are not one of them. It is time for you to begin
//contributing to this expedition. You have known Severus Snape more recently
//than I. Tell me your own analysis of this room.”

// 18295
//Harry hesitated, trying to look thoughtful.

// 18296
//“I will mention,” said Professor Quirrell, as the blackened-fire-phoenix on his
//shoulder seemed to extend its head and glare at Harry, “that if you knowingly
//allow me to fail, I will call it betrayal. I remind you that the Stone is key
//to Miss Granger’s resurrection, and that I hold hostage the lives of hundreds
//of students.”

// 18297
//“I remember,” Harry said, and on the heels of this Harry’s wonderful inventive
//brain came up with a thought.

// 18298
//Harry wasn’t sure if he should say it.

// 18299
//The silence stretched.

// 18300
//“Have you thought of anything yet?” said Professor Quirrell. “Answer in
//Parseltongue.”

// 18301
//No, this was __not__ going to be easy, not against a smart opponent who
//could force you to tell the literal truth at any time. “Severus, at least the
//modern-day Severus, respects your intelligence a great deal,” Harry said
//instead. “I think… I think he might __expect__ Voldemort to believe that
//Severus wouldn’t believe that Voldemort could pass his test of patience, but
//Severus __would__ expect Voldemort to pass it.”

// 18302
//Professor Quirrell nodded. “That is a plausible theory. Do you believe it
//yourself? Answer in Parseltongue.”

// 18303
//__“Yess,__” Harry hissed. It might not be safe to withhold information,
//not even thoughts and ideas… “Therefore, the point of this room is to delay
//Lord Voldemort for an hour. And if I wanted to kill you, believing what
//Dumbledore believes, the obvious thing to try would be a Dementor’s Kiss. I
//mean, they think you’re a disembodied soul - are you, by the way?”

// 18304
//Professor Quirrell was still. “Dumbledore would not think of that method,” the
//Defense Professor said after a time. “But Severus might.” Professor Quirrell
//began to tap a finger against his cheek, his gaze distant. “You have power over
//Dementors, boy, can you tell me if there are any nearby?”

// 18305
//Harry closed his eyes. If there were voids in the world, he could not feel
//them. “None that I can sense.”

// 18306
//“Answer in Parseltongue.”

// 18307
//“__Do not ssensse life-eaterss.__”

// 18308
//“But you were being honest with me when you suggested the possibility? You
//intended no clever trickery?”

// 18309
//“__Wass honesst. Not trick.__”

// 18310
//“Perhaps there is some means by which Dementors might be concealed, being told
//to leap out and eat a possessing soul if they see one…” Professor Quirrell was
//still tapping his cheek. “It is not impossible that I would qualify. Or it can
//be told to eat anyone who passes through this room too quickly, or anyone who
//is not a child. Bearing in mind that I hold Hermione and hundreds of other
//students hostage over you, would you use your power over Dementors to defend
//me, if a Dementor unmasked itself? Answer in Parseltongue.”

// 18311
//“__Don’t know,__” Harry hissed.

// 18312
//“__Life-eaterss cannot desstroy me, I think,__” hissed Professor Quirrell.
//”__And I will ssimply abandon thiss body if they approach too closse.
//Sshall return sswiftly thiss time, and then there will be no sstopping me. Will
//torture your parentss for yearss, to punissh you for balking me. Hundredss of
//hosstage sstudentss die, including thosse you call friendss. Now I assk again.
//Will you usse power over life-eaterss to protect me, if life-eaterss come?__”

// 18313
//“__Yess,__” Harry whispered. The sadness and horror that Harry had pushed
//down flared up again, and his dark side had no stored patterns for handling the
//emotions. __Why, Professor Quirrell, why are you like this…__

// 18314
//Professor Quirrell smiled. “That reminds me. Have you betrayed me yet?”

// 18315
//“__Have not betrayed you yet.__”

// 18316
//Professor Quirrell went over to the Potions equipment, and began chopping a
//root one-handed, the knife moving almost invisibly fast and with no apparent
//effort. The Fiendfyre phoenix drifted over to the opposite corner of the room
//and waited there. “All matters considered in their uncertainty, it seems wiser
//to expend the time to pass this room as a first-year would,” said the Defense
//Professor. “We may as well talk while we are waiting. You had questions, boy? I
//said that I would answer them, so ask.”
