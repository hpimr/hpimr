//== TSPE, Aftermaths

// 10892
//__Aftermath, Hermione Granger:__

// 10893
//She was just starting to close up her books and put away her homework in
//preparation for sleep, Padma and Mandy stacking up their own books across the
//table from her, when Harry Potter walked into the Ravenclaw common room; and it
//was only then that she realized, she hadn’t seen him at all since breakfast.

// 10894
//That realization was rapidly stomped-on by a much more startling one.

// 10895
//There was a golden-red winged creature on Harry’s shoulder, a bright bird of
//fire.

// 10896
//And Harry looked sad and worn and really __tired__ like the phoenix was
//the only thing keeping him on his feet, but there was still a warmth about him,
//if you crossed your eyes you might have thought you were looking at the
//Headmaster somehow, that was the impression that went through Hermione’s mind
//even though it didn’t make any sense.

// 10897
//Harry Potter trudged across the Ravenclaw common room, past sofas full of
//staring girls, past cardgame-circles of staring boys, heading for her.

// 10898
//In theory she wasn’t talking to Harry Potter yet, his week wasn’t up until
//tomorrow, but whatever was going on was clearly a __whole__ lot more
//important than that -

// 10899
//“Fawkes,” Harry said, just as she was opening her mouth, “that girl over there
//is Hermione Granger, she’s not talking to me right now because I’m an idiot,
//but if you want to be on a good person’s shoulder she’s better than me.”

// 10900
//So much exhaustion and hurt in Harry Potter’s voice -

// 10901
//But before she could figure out what to do about it, the phoenix had glided off
//Harry’s shoulder like a fire creeping up a matchstick on fast-forward, flashing
//toward her; there was a phoenix flying in front of her and staring at her with
//eyes of light and flame.

// 10902
//“__Caw?__” asked the phoenix.

// 10903
//Hermione stared at it, feeling like she was facing a question on a test she’d
//forgotten to study for, the one most important question and she’d gone her
//whole life without studying for it, she couldn’t find anything to say.

// 10904
//“I’m -” she said. “I’m only twelve, I haven’t __done__ anything yet -”

// 10905
//The phoenix just glided gently around, rotating around one wingtip like the
//being of light and air that it was, and soared back to Harry Potter’s shoulder,
//where it settled down quite firmly.

// 10906
//“You silly boy,” said Padma across from her, looking like she was deciding
//whether to laugh or grimace, “phoenixes aren’t for smart girls who do their
//homework, they’re for idiots who charge straight at five older Slytherin
//bullies. There’s a reason why the Gryffindor colors are red and gold, you
//know.”

// 10907
//There was a lot of friendly laughter in the Ravenclaw common room.

// 10908
//Hermione wasn’t one of the laughing ones.

// 10909
//Neither was Harry.

// 10910
//Harry had put a hand over his face. “Tell Hermione I’m sorry,” he said to
//Padma, his voice almost fallen to a whisper. “Tell her I forgot that phoenixes
//are animals, they don’t understand time and planning, they don’t understand
//people who are __going__ to do good things later - I’m not sure they
//understand really the notion of there being something that a person
//__is__, all they see is what people do. Fawkes doesn’t know what twelve
//means. Tell Hermione I’m sorry - I shouldn’t have - it just all goes wrong,
//doesn’t it?”

// 10911
//Harry turned to go, the phoenix still on his shoulder, began slowly trudging
//toward the staircase that led up to his dorm.

// 10912
//And Hermione couldn’t leave it at that, she just __couldn’t__ leave it at
//that. She didn’t know if it was her competition with Harry or something else.
//She just couldn’t leave it with the phoenix turning away from her.

// 10913
//She __had__ to -

// 10914
//Her mind keyed a frantic question to the entirety of her excellent memory,
//found just one thing -

// 10915
//“I was going to run in front of the Dementor to try and save Harry!” she
//shouted a little desperately at the red-golden bird. “I mean, I actually did
//start running and everything! That was stupid and courageous, right?”

// 10916
//With a warbling cry the phoenix launched itself from Harry’s shoulder again,
//back toward her like a spreading blaze, it circled her three times like she was
//the center of an inferno, and for just a moment its wing brushed against her
//cheek, before the phoenix soared back to Harry.

// 10917
//There was a hush in the Ravenclaw common room.

// 10918
//“Told you so,” Harry said aloud, and then he started climbing the stairs up to
//his bedroom; he seemed to climb very quickly, like he was very light on his
//feet for some reason, so that in just a moment he and Fawkes were gone.

// 10919
//Hermione held up a trembling hand to her cheek where Fawkes had brushed her
//with his wing, a spot of warmth lingering there like that one small patch of
//skin had been very gently set on fire.

// 10920
//She’d answered the question of the phoenix, she supposed, but it felt to her
//like she’d just barely squeaked by on the test, like she’d gotten a 62 and she
//could’ve gotten 104 if she’d tried harder.

// 10921
//If she’d tried at __all__.

// 10922
//She hadn’t really __been__ trying, when she thought about it.

// 10923
//Just doing her homework -

// 10924
//__Who have you saved?__

// 10925
//__Aftermath, Fawkes:__

// 10926
//Nightmares, the boy had expected, screams and begging and howling hurricanes of
//emptiness, the discharge of the horrors being laid down into memory, and in
//that fashion, perhaps, becoming part of the past.

// 10927
//And the boy knew that the nightmares would come.

// 10928
//The next night, they would come.

// 10929
//The boy dreamed, and in his dreams the world was on fire, Hogwarts was on fire,
//his home was on fire, the streets of Oxford were on fire, all ablaze with
//golden flames that shone but did not consume, and all the people walking
//through the blazing streets were shining with white light brighter than the
//fire, like they were flames themselves, or stars.

// 10930
//The other first-year boys came to bed, and saw it for themselves, the wonder
//whose rumor they had already heard, that in his bed Harry Potter lay silent and
//motionless, a gentle smile on his face, while perched on his pillow a
//red-golden bird watched over him, with bright wings swept above him like a
//blanket pulled over his head.

// 10931
//The reckoning had been put off one more night.

// 10932
//__Aftermath, Draco Malfoy:__

// 10933
//Draco straightened his robes, making sure the green trim was straight. He waved
//his wand over his own head and said a Charm that Father had taught him while
//other children were still playing in mud, a Charm which ensured that not a
//single speck of lint or dust would dirty his wizard’s robes.

// 10934
//Draco picked up the mysterious envelope that Father had owled him, and tucked
//it into his robes. He had already used __Incendio__ and __Everto__ on
//the mysterious note.

// 10935
//And then he headed off to breakfast, to seat himself on exactly the same tick
//of the clock where the food appeared, if he could manage it, so that it would
//seem like all others had been waiting on his appearance to eat. Because when
//you were the scion of Malfoy you were first in everything, including breakfast,
//that was why.

// 10936
//Vincent and Gregory were waiting for him outside the door of his private room,
//up even before he was - though not, of course, dressed quite as sharply.

// 10937
//The Slytherin common room was deserted, anyone who got up this early was
//heading straight to breakfast anyway.

// 10938
//The dungeon halls were silent but for their own footsteps, empty and echoing.

// 10939
//The Great Hall was a hubbub of alarm despite the relative few arrivals, some
//younger children crying, students running back and forth between tables or
//standing in knots shouting at each other, a red-robed prefect was standing in
//front of two green-trimmed students and yelling at them and Snape was striding
//toward the mess -

// 10940
//The noise dimmed a little as people caught sight of Draco, as some of the faces
//turned to stare at him, and fell quiet.

// 10941
//The food appeared on the tables. No one looked at it.

// 10942
//And Snape spun on his heel, abandoning his target, and headed straight toward
//Draco.

// 10943
//A knot of fear clutched at Draco’s heart, had something happened to Father -
//no, surely Father would have told him - whatever was happening, why hadn’t
//Father told him -

// 10944
//There were bags of fatigue beneath Snape’s eyes, Draco saw as their Head of
//House came close, the Potions Master had never been a sharp dresser (that was
//an understatement) but his robes were even dirtier and more disarrayed this
//morning, spotted with extra grease.

// 10945
//“You haven’t heard?” hissed their Head of House as he came close. “For pity’s
//sake, Malfoy, don’t you have a newspaper delivered?”

// 10946
//“What is it, Profe-”

// 10947
//“Bellatrix Black was taken from Azkaban!”

// 10948
//“__What?__” said Draco in shock, as Gregory behind him said something he
//really shouldn’t have and Vincent just gasped.

// 10949
//Snape was gazing at him with narrowed eyes, then nodded abruptly. “Lucius told
//you nothing, then. I see.” Snape gave a snort, turned away -

// 10950
//“Professor!” said Draco. The implications were just starting to dawn on him,
//his mind spinning frantically. “Professor, what should I do - Father didn’t
//instruct me -”

// 10951
//“Then I __suggest__,” Snape said sneeringly, as he strode away, “that you
//__tell__ them that, Malfoy, as your father intended!”

// 10952
//Draco glanced back at Vincent and Gregory, though he didn’t know why he was
//bothering, of course they looked even more confused than he did.

// 10953
//And Draco walked forward to the Slytherin table, and sat down at the far end,
//which was still empty of sitters.

// 10954
//Draco put a sausage omelet on his plate, began eating it with automatic
//motions.

// 10955
//Bellatrix Black had been taken from Azkaban.

// 10956
//Bellatrix Black had been taken from Azkaban…?

// 10957
//Draco didn’t know what to make of that, it was as totally unexpected as the Sun
//going out - well, the Sun would expectedly go out in six billion years but this
//was as unexpected as the Sun going out __tomorrow__. Father wouldn’t have
//done it, Dumbledore wouldn’t have done it, __no one__ should have been
//__able__ to do it - what did it __mean__ - what __use__ would
//Bellatrix be to anyone after ten years in Azkaban - even if she got strong
//again, what use was a powerful sorceress who was completely evil and insane and
//fanatically devoted to a Dark Lord who wasn’t around anymore?

// 10958
//“Hey,” said Vincent from where he was sitting next to Draco, “I don’t
//understand, boss, why’d we do that?”

// 10959
//“__We__ didn’t do it, you dolt!” snapped Draco. “Oh, for Merlin’s sake, if
//even __you__ think we - didn’t your father ever tell you any stories about
//Bellatrix Black? She tortured Father once, she tortured __your__ father,
//she’s tortured __everyone,__ the Dark Lord once told her to Crucio
//__herself__ and she __did it!__ She didn’t do crazy things to inspire
//fear and obedience in the populace, she did crazy things because she’s crazy!
//She’s a __bitch__ is what she is!”

// 10960
//“Oh, really?” said an incensed voice from behind Draco.

// 10961
//Draco didn’t look up. Gregory and Vincent would be watching his back.

// 10962
//“I would’ve thought you’d be happy -”

// 10963
//“- to hear that a Death Eater had been freed, Malfoy!”

// 10964
//Amycus Carrow had always been one of the __other__ problem people; Father
//had once told Draco to make sure he was never alone in the same room with
//Amycus…

// 10965
//Draco turned around and gave Flora and Hestia Carrow his Number Three Sneer,
//the one that said that he was in a Noble and Most Ancient House and they
//weren’t and yes, that mattered. Draco said in their general direction,
//certainly not deigning to address __them__ in particular, “There’s Death
//Eaters and then there’s Death Eaters,” and then turned back to his food.

// 10966
//There were two furious huffs in unison, and then two pairs of shoes stormed off
//toward the other end of the Slytherin table.

// 10967
//It was a few minutes later that Millicent Bulstrode ran up to them, visibly out
//of breath, and said, “Mr. Malfoy, did you hear?”

// 10968
//“About Bellatrix Black?” said Draco. “Yeah -”

// 10969
//“No, about Potter!”

// 10970
//“What?”

// 10971
//“Potter was going around with a __phoenix__ on his shoulder last night,
//looking like he’d been dragged through ten leagues of mud, they say that the
//phoenix took him to Azkaban to try to stop Bellatrix and he fought a duel with
//her and they blew up half the fortress!”

// 10972
//“__What?__” said Draco. “Oh, there is just no __way__ that -”

// 10973
//Draco stopped.

// 10974
//He’d said that a number of times about Harry Potter and had started to notice a
//trend.

// 10975
//Millicent ran off to tell someone else.

// 10976
//“You don’t __really__ think -” said Gregory.

// 10977
//“I honestly don’t know anymore,” said Draco.

// 10978
//A few minutes later, after Theodore Nott had sat down across from him and
//William Rosier had gone to sit with the Carrow twins, Vincent nudged him and
//said, “There.”

// 10979
//Harry Potter had entered the Great Hall.

// 10980
//Draco watched him closely.

// 10981
//There was no alarm on Harry’s face as he saw, no surprise or shock, he just
//looked…

// 10982
//It was the same distant, self-absorbed look Harry wore when he was trying to
//figure out the answer to a question Draco couldn’t understand yet.

// 10983
//Draco hastily shoved himself up from the bench of the Slytherin table, saying
//“Stay behind,” and walked with all decorous speed toward Harry.

// 10984
//Harry seemed to notice his approach just as the other boy was turning toward
//the Ravenclaw table, and Draco -

// 10985
//- gave Harry one quick look -

// 10986
//- and then walked right past him, straight out of the Great Hall.

// 10987
//It was a minute later that Harry peered around the corner of the small stony
//nook where Draco had waited, it might not fool everyone but it would create
//plausible deniability.

// 10988
//“__Quietus__,” said Harry. “Draco, what -”

// 10989
//Draco took the envelope out of his robes. “I have a message for you from
//Father.”

// 10990
//“__Huh?__” said Harry, and took the envelope from Draco, and tore it open
//in a rather un-neat manner, and drew forth a sheet of parchment and unfolded it
//and -

// 10991
//Harry gave a sharp intake of breath.

// 10992
//Then Harry looked at Draco.

// 10993
//Then Harry looked back down at the parchment.

// 10994
//There was a pause.

// 10995
//Harry said, “Did Lucius tell you to report on my reaction to this?”

// 10996
//Draco paused for a moment, weighing, and then opened his mouth -

// 10997
//“I see he did,” said Harry, and Draco cursed himself, he should’ve known
//better, only it __had__ been hard to decide. “What are you going to tell
//him?”

// 10998
//“That you were surprised,” said Draco.

// 10999
//“Surprised,” Harry said flatly. “Yeah. Good. Tell him that.”

// 11000
//“What __is__ it?” said Draco. And then, as he saw Harry looking
//conflicted, “If you’re dealing with Father behind my back -”

// 11001
//And Harry, without a word, gave Draco the paper.

// 11002
//It said:

// 11003
//__I know it was you.__

// 11004
//“__WHAT THE -__”

// 11005
//“I was going to ask __you__ that,” said Harry. “Have you got __any__
//idea what’s up with your Dad?”

// 11006
//Draco stared at Harry.

// 11007
//Then Draco said, “__Did__ you do it?”

// 11008
//“What?” said Harry. “What __possible__ reason would I - __how__ would
//I -”

// 11009
//“Did you do it, Harry?”

// 11010
//“No!” Harry said. “Of course not!”

// 11011
//Draco had listened carefully, but he hadn’t detected any hesitation or tremor.

// 11012
//So Draco nodded, and said, “I’ve got no idea what Father’s thinking but it
//__can’t__, I mean it __can’t possibly__ be good. And, um… people are
//also saying…”

// 11013
//“What,” said Harry warily, “are they saying, Draco?”

// 11014
//“Did a phoenix __really__ take you to Azkaban to try to stop Bellatrix
//Black from escaping -”

// 11015
//__Aftermath: Neville Longbottom__

// 11016
//Harry had only just sat down at the Ravenclaw table for the first time, hoping
//to grab a quick bite of food. He knew he needed to go off and think about
//things, but there was a tiny remaining bit of phoenix’s peace (even after the
//encounter with Draco) that he still wanted to cling to, some beautiful dream of
//which he remembered nothing but the beauty; and the part of him that
//__wasn’t__ feeling peaceful was waiting for all the anvils to finish
//dropping on him, so that when he went off to think and be by himself for a
//while, he could batch-process all the disasters at once.

// 11017
//Harry’s hand grasped a fork, lifted a bite of mashed potatoes toward his mouth
//-

// 11018
//And there was a shriek.

// 11019
//Every now and then someone would shout when they heard the news, but Harry’s
//ears __recognized__ this one -

// 11020
//Harry was up from the bench in an instant, heading toward the Hufflepuff table,
//a horrible sick feeling dawning in the pit of his stomach. It was one of those
//things he hadn’t considered when he’d decided to commit the crime, because
//Professor Quirrell had planned for no one to know; and now, afterward, Harry
//just - hadn’t __thought__ of it -

// 11021
//__This,__ Hufflepuff said with bitter intensity, __is also your
//fault.__

// 11022
//But by the time Harry got there, Neville was sitting down and eating fried
//sausage patties with Snippyfig Sauce.

// 11023
//The Hufflepuff boy’s hands were trembling, but he cut the food, and ate it,
//without dropping it.

// 11024
//“Hello, General,” Neville said, his voice wavering only slightly. “Did you
//fight a duel with Bellatrix Black last night?”

// 11025
//“No,” Harry said. His own voice was also wavery, for some reason.

// 11026
//“Didn’t think so,” said Neville. There was a scraping sound as his knife cut
//the sausage again. “I’m going to hunt her down and kill her, can I count on you
//to help?”

// 11027
//There were startled gasps from the mass of Hufflepuffs who had gathered around
//Neville.

// 11028
//“If she comes after you,” Harry said hoarsely, __if it was all a terrible
//mistake, if it was all a lie, __“I’ll defend you even with my life,”
//__won’t let you get hurt for what I did, no matter what, __“but I won’t
//help you go after her, Neville, friends don’t help friends commit suicide.”

// 11029
//Neville’s fork paused on the way to his mouth.

// 11030
//Then Neville put the bite of food in his mouth, chewed again.

// 11031
//And Neville swallowed it.

// 11032
//And Neville said, “I didn’t mean __right now__, I mean after I graduate
//Hogwarts.”

// 11033
//“Neville,” Harry said, keeping his voice under very careful control, “I think,
//even after you graduate, that might still be a __just plain__
//__stupid idea.__ There’s got to be much more experienced Aurors tracking
//her -” __oh, wait, that’s not good __-

// 11034
//“Listen to him!” said Ernie Macmillan, and then an older-looking Hufflepuff
//girl standing close to Neville said, “Nevvy, please, think about it, he’s
//right!”

// 11035
//Neville stood up.

// 11036
//Neville said, “Please don’t follow me.”

// 11037
//Neville walked away from all of them; Harry and Ernie reaching out
//involuntarily toward him, and some of the other Hufflepuffs as well.

// 11038
//And Neville sat down at the Gryffindor table, and distantly (though they had to
//strain to hear) they heard Neville say, “I’m going to hunt her down and kill
//her after I graduate, anyone want to help?” and at least five voices said “Yes”
//and then Ron Weasley said loudly, “Get in line, you lot, I got an owl from Mum
//this morning, she says to tell everyone she’s called dibs” and someone said
//“__Molly Weasley__ against __Bellatrix Black?__ Who does she even
//think she’s kidding -” and Ron reached over to a plate and hefted a muffin -

// 11039
//Someone tapped Harry on the shoulder, and he turned around and saw an
//unfamiliar green-trimmed older girl, who handed him a parchment envelope and
//then quickly strode away.

// 11040
//Harry stared at the envelope for a moment, then started walking toward the
//nearest wall. That wasn’t very private, but it should be private enough, and
//Harry didn’t want to give the impression of having much to hide.

// 11041
//That had been a Slytherin System delivery, what you used if you wanted to
//communicate with someone without anyone else knowing that the two of you had
//talked. The sender gave an envelope to someone who had a reputation for being a
//reliable messenger, along with ten Knuts; that first person would take five
//Knuts and pass the envelope to another messenger along with the other five
//Knuts, and the second messenger would open up that envelope and find another
//envelope with a name written on it and deliver that envelope to that person.
//That way neither of the two people passing the message knew both the sender
//__and__ the recipient, so no one else knew that those two parties had been
//in contact…

// 11042
//When Harry reached the wall, he put the envelope inside his robes, opened it
//beneath the folds of cloth, and carefully snuck a peek at the parchment he drew
//forth.

// 11043
//It said,

// 11044
//__Classroom to the left of Transfiguration, 8 in the morning.__

// 11045
//__- LL.__

// 11046
//Harry stared at it, trying to remember if he knew anyone with the initials LL.

// 11047
//His mind searched…

// 11048
//Searched…

// 11049
//Retrieved -

// 11050
//“The __Quibbler__ girl?” Harry whispered incredulously, and then shut his
//mouth. She was only ten years old, she shouldn’t be in Hogwarts at all!

// 11051
//__Aftermath: Lesath Lestrange.__

// 11052
//Harry was standing in the unused classroom next to Transfiguration at 8AM,
//waiting, he’d at least managed to get some food into himself before facing the
//next disaster, Luna Lovegood…

// 11053
//The door to the classroom opened, and Harry saw, and gave himself a really
//__hard__ mental kick.

// 11054
//One more thing he hadn’t thought of, one more thing he __really should
//have.__

// 11055
//The older boy’s green-trimmed formal robes were askew, there were red spots on
//them looking very much like small dots of fresh blood, and one corner of his
//mouth had the look of a place that had been cut and healed, by __Episkey__
//or some other minor medical Charm that didn’t quite erase all the damage.

// 11056
//Lesath Lestrange’s face was streaked with tears, fresh tears and half-dried
//tears, and there was water in his eyes, a promise of still more on the way.
//“__Quietus,__” said the older boy, and then ”__Homenum Revelio__” and
//some other things, while Harry thought frantically and without much luck.

// 11057
//And then Lesath lowered his wand and sheathed it in his robes, and slowly this
//time, formally, the older boy dropped to his knees on the dusty classroom
//floor.

// 11058
//Bowed his head all the way down, until his forehead also touched the dust, and
//Harry would have spoken but he was voiceless.

// 11059
//Lesath Lestrange said, in a breaking voice, “My life is yours, my Lord, and my
//death as well.”

// 11060
//“I,” Harry said, there was a huge lump in his throat and he was having trouble
//speaking, “I -” __didn’t have anything to do with it,__ he should have
//been saying, should be saying __right now,__ but then again the innocent
//Harry would have had trouble speaking too -

// 11061
//“Thank you,” whispered Lesath, “thank you, my Lord, oh, thank you,” the sound
//of a choked-off sob came from the kneeling boy, all Harry could see of him was
//the hair on the back of his head, nothing of his face. “I’m a fool, my Lord, an
//ungrateful bastard, unworthy to serve you, I cannot abase myself enough, for I
//- I shouted at you after you helped me, because I thought you were refusing me,
//and I didn’t even realize until this morning that I’d been such a fool as to
//ask you in front of Longbottom -”

// 11062
//“I didn’t have anything to do with it,” Harry said.

// 11063
//(It was still very hard to tell an outright lie like that.)

// 11064
//Slowly Lesath raised his head from the floor, looked up at Harry.

// 11065
//“I understand, my Lord,” said the older boy, his voice wavering a little, “you
//do not trust my cunning, and indeed I have shown myself a fool… I only wanted
//to say to you, that I am not ungrateful, that I know it must have been hard
//enough to save only one person, that they’re alerted now, that you can’t - get
//Father - but I am not ungrateful, I will never be ungrateful to you again. If
//ever you have a use for this unworthy servant, call me wherever I am, and I
//will answer, my Lord -”

// 11066
//“I was not involved in any way.”

// 11067
//(But it got easier each time.)

// 11068
//Lesath gazed up at Harry, said uncertainly, “Am I dismissed from your presence,
//my Lord…?”

// 11069
//“I am not your Lord.”

// 11070
//Lesath said, “Yes, my Lord, I understand,” and pushed himself back up from the
//floor, stood straight and bowed deeply, then backed away from Harry until he
//turned to open the classroom door.

// 11071
//As Lesath’s hand touched the doorknob, he paused.

// 11072
//Harry couldn’t see Lesath’s face, as the older boy’s voice said, “Did you send
//her to someone who would take care of her? Did she ask about me at all?”

// 11073
//And Harry said, his voice perfectly level, “Please stop that. I was not
//involved in any way.”

// 11074
//“Yes, my Lord, I’m sorry, my Lord,” said Lesath’s voice; and the Slytherin boy
//opened the door and went out and shut the door behind him. His feet sped up as
//he ran away, but not fast enough that Harry couldn’t hear him start sobbing.

// 11075
//__Would I cry?__ wondered Harry. __If I knew nothing, if I was
//innocent, would I cry right now?__

// 11076
//Harry didn’t know, so he just kept looking at the door.

// 11077
//And some unbelievably tactless part of him thought, __Yay, we completed a
//quest and got a minion -__

// 11078
//__Shut up. If you ever want to vote on anything ever again… shut up.__

// 11079
//__Aftermath, Amelia Bones:__

// 11080
//“Then his life isn’t in danger, I take it,” said Amelia.

// 11081
//The healer, a stern-eyed old man who wore his robes white (he was a Muggleborn
//and honoring some strange tradition of Muggles, of which Amelia had never
//asked, although privately she thought it made him look too much like a ghost),
//shook his head and said, “Definitely not.”

// 11082
//Amelia looked at the human form resting unconscious on the healer’s bed, the
//burned and blasted flesh, the thin sheet that covered him for modesty’s sake
//having been peeled back at her command.

// 11083
//He might make a full recovery.

// 11084
//He might not.

// 11085
//The healer had said it was too early to say.

// 11086
//Then Amelia looked at the other witch in the room, the detective.

// 11087
//“And you say,” Amelia said, “that the burning matter was Transfigured from
//__water__, presumably in the form of ice.”

// 11088
//The detective nodded her head, and said, sounding puzzled, “It could have been
//much worse, if not for -”

// 11089
//“How __very nice__ of them,” she spat, and then pressed a weary hand to
//her forehead. No… no, it __had__ been intended as a kindness. By the final
//stage of the escape there would be no point in trying to fool anyone. Whoever
//had done this, then, __had__ been trying to mitigate the damage - and
//they’d been thinking in terms of Aurors breathing the smoke, not of anyone
//being attacked with the fire. If it had been them still in control, no doubt,
//they would have steered the rocker more mercifully.

// 11090
//But Bellatrix Black had ridden the rocker out of Azkaban alone, all the
//watching Aurors had agreed on that, they’d had their Anti-Disillusionment
//Charms active and there had been only one woman on that rocker, though the
//rocker had sported two sets of stirrups.

// 11091
//Some good and innocent person, capable of casting the Patronus Charm, had been
//tricked into rescuing Bellatrix Black.

// 11092
//Some innocent had fought Bahry One-Hand, carefully subduing an experienced
//Auror without significantly injuring him.

// 11093
//Some innocent had Transfigured the fuel for the Muggle artifact on which the
//two of them had been to ride out of Azkaban, making it from frozen water for
//the benefit of her Aurors.

// 11094
//And then their usefulness to Bellatrix Black had ended.

// 11095
//You would have expected anyone capable of subduing Bahry One-Hand to have
//foreseen that part. But then you wouldn’t have expected anyone who could cast
//the Patronus Charm to try rescuing Bellatrix Black in the first place.

// 11096
//Amelia passed her hand down over her eyes, closing them for a moment in silent
//mourning. __I wonder who it was, and how You-Know-Who manipulated them…
//what story they could __possibly__ have been told…__

// 11097
//She didn’t even realize until a moment later that the thought meant she was
//starting to believe. Perhaps because, no matter how difficult it was to believe
//Dumbledore, it was becoming more difficult __not__ to recognize the hand
//of that cold, dark intelligence.

// 11098
//__Aftermath, Albus Dumbledore:__

// 11099
//It might have been only fifty-seven seconds before breakfast ended and he might
//have needed four twists of his Time-Turner, but in the end, Albus Dumbledore
//did make it.

// 11100
//“Headmaster?” squeaked the polite voice of Professor Filius Flitwick, as the
//old wizard passed him by on his way to his seat. “Mr. Potter left a message for
//you.”

// 11101
//The old wizard stopped. He looked inquiringly at the Charms Professor.

// 11102
//“Mr. Potter said that after he woke up, he realized how unfair had been the
//things he said to you after Fawkes screamed. Mr. Potter said that he wasn’t
//saying anything about anything else, just apologizing for that one part.”

// 11103
//The old wizard kept looking at his Charms Professor, and still did not speak.

// 11104
//“Headmaster?” squeaked Filius.

// 11105
//“Tell him I said thank you,” said Albus Dumbledore, “but that it is wiser to
//listen to phoenixes than to wise old wizards,” and sat down at his place three
//seconds before all the food vanished.

// 11106
//__Aftermath, Professor Quirrell:__

// 11107
//“No,” Madam Pomfrey snapped at the child, “you may __not__ see him! You
//may not __pester__ him! You may not ask him__ one little question!__
//He is to rest __in bed__ and do __nothing__ for at least
//__three days!__”

// 11108
//__Aftermath, Minerva McGonagall:__

// 11109
//She was heading toward the infirmary, and Harry Potter was leaving it, when
//they passed each other.

// 11110
//The look he gave her wasn’t angry.

// 11111
//It wasn’t sad.

// 11112
//It didn’t say much at all.

// 11113
//It was like… like he was looking at her just long enough to make it clear that
//he __wasn’t__ deliberately avoiding looking at her.

// 11114
//And then he looked away before she could figure out what look to give him in
//return; as though he wanted to spare her that, as well.

// 11115
//He didn’t say anything as he walked past her.

// 11116
//Neither did she.

// 11117
//What could there possibly be to say?

// 11118
//__Aftermath, Fred and George Weasley:__

// 11119
//They actually yelped out loud, when they turned the corner and saw Dumbledore.

// 11120
//It wasn’t that the Headmaster had popped up out of nowhere and was staring at
//them with a stern expression. Dumbledore was always doing __that__.

// 11121
//But the wizard was dressed in formal black robes and looking __very__
//ancient and __very__ powerful and he was giving the two of them a SHARP
//LOOK.

// 11122
//“Fred and George Weasley!” spake Dumbledore in a Voice of Power.

// 11123
//“Yes, Headmaster!” they said, snapping upright and giving him a crisp military
//salute they’d seen in some old pictures.

// 11124
//“Hear me well! You are the friends of Harry Potter, is this so?”

// 11125
//“Yes, Headmaster!”

// 11126
//“Harry Potter is in danger. He __must not__ go beyond the wards of
//Hogwarts. Listen to me, sons of Weasley, I beg you listen: you know that I am
//as Gryffindor as yourselves, that I too know there are higher rules than rules.
//But this, Fred and George, this one thing is of the most terrible importance,
//there must be no exception this time, small or great! If you help Harry to
//leave Hogwarts he may __die!__ Does he send you on a mission, you may go,
//does he ask you to bring him items, you may help, but if he asks you to smuggle
//his own person out of Hogwarts, you __must refuse!__ Do you understand?”

// 11127
//“Yes, Headmaster!” They said it without even thinking, really, and then
//exchanged uncertain looks with each other -

// 11128
//The bright blue eyes of the Headmaster were intent upon them. “No. Not without
//thinking. If Harry asks you to bring him out, you must refuse, if he asks you
//to tell him the way, you must refuse. I will not ask you to report him to me,
//for that I know you would never do. But beg him on my behalf to go to
//__me,__ if it is of such importance, and __I__ will guard him as he
//walks. Fred, George, I am sorry to strain your friendship so, but it is his
//__life.__”

// 11129
//The two of them looked at each other for a long while, not communicating, only
//thinking the same things at the same time.

// 11130
//They looked back at Dumbledore.

// 11131
//They said, with a chill running through them as they spoke the name, “Bellatrix
//Black.”

// 11132
//“You may safely assume,” said the Headmaster, “that it is at least that bad.”

// 11133
//“Okay -”

// 11134
//“- got it.”

// 11135
//__Aftermath, Alastor Moody and Severus Snape:__

// 11136
//When Alastor Moody had lost his eye, he had commandeered the services of a most
//erudite Ravenclaw, Samuel H. Lyall, whom Moody mistrusted slightly less than
//average because Moody had refrained from reporting him as an unregistered
//werewolf; and he had paid Lyall to compile a list of every known magical eye,
//and every known hint to their location.

// 11137
//When Moody had gotten the list back, he hadn’t bothered reading most of it;
//because at the top of the list was the Eye of Vance, dating back to an era
//before Hogwarts, and currently in the possession of a powerful Dark Wizard
//ruling over some tiny forgotten hellhole that wasn’t in Britain or anywhere
//else he’d have to worry about silly rules.

// 11138
//That was how Alastor Moody had lost his left foot and acquired the Eye of
//Vance, and how the oppressed souls of Urulat had been liberated for a period of
//around two weeks before another Dark Wizard moved in on the power vacuum.

// 11139
//He’d considered going after the Left Foot of Vance next, but had decided
//against it after he realized that would be __just what they were
//expecting.__

// 11140
//Now Mad-Eye Moody was turning slowly, always turning, surveying the graveyard
//of Little Hangleton. It should have been a lot gloomier, that place, but in the
//broad daylight it seemed like nothing but a grassy place marked by ordinary
//tombstones, demarcated by the chained twists of fragile, easily climbable metal
//that Muggles used instead of wards. (Moody could not comprehend what the
//Muggles were thinking on that score, if they were __pretending__ to have
//wards, or what, and he had decided not to ask whether Muggle criminals
//respected the pretense.)

// 11141
//Moody didn’t actually __need__ to turn to survey the graveyard.

// 11142
//The Eye of Vance saw the full globe of the world in every direction around him,
//no matter where it was pointing.

// 11143
//But there was no particular reason to let a former Death Eater like Severus
//Snape know that.

// 11144
//Sometimes people called Moody ‘paranoid’.

// 11145
//Moody always told them to survive a hundred years of hunting Dark Wizards and
//then get back to him about that.

// 11146
//Mad-Eye Moody had once worked out how long it had taken him, in retrospect, to
//achieve what he now considered a decent level of caution - weighed up how much
//experience it had taken him to get __good__ instead of __lucky__ -
//and had begun to suspect that most people died before they got there. Moody had
//once expressed this thought to Lyall, who had done some ciphering and figuring,
//and told him that a typical Dark Wizard hunter would die, on average, eight and
//a half times along the way to becoming ‘paranoid’. This explained a great deal,
//assuming Lyall wasn’t lying.

// 11147
//Yesterday, Albus Dumbledore had told Mad-Eye Moody that the Dark Lord had used
//unspeakable dark arts to survive the death of his body, and was now awake and
//abroad, seeking to regain his power and begin the Wizarding War anew.

// 11148
//Someone else might have reacted with incredulity.

// 11149
//“I can’t believe you lot never told me about this resurrection thing,” Mad-Eye
//Moody said with considerable acerbity. “D’you realize how long it’ll take me to
//do the grave of every ancestor of every Dark Wizard I’ve ever killed who
//could’ve been smart enough to make a horcrux? You’re not just __now__
//doing this one, are you?”

// 11150
//“I redose this one every year,” Severus Snape said calmly, uncapping the third
//flask of what the man had __claimed__ would be seventeen bottles, and
//beginning to wave his wand over it. “The other ancestral graves we’ve been able
//to locate were poisoned with only the long-lasting substances, since some of us
//have less free time than yourself.”

// 11151
//Moody watched the fluid spiraling out of the vial and vanishing, to appear
//within the bones where marrow had once been. “But you think it’s worth the
//effort of the trap, instead of just Vanishing the bones.”

// 11152
//“He __does__ have other avenues to life, should he perceive this one
//blocked,” Snape said dryly, uncapping a fourth bottle. “And before you ask, it
//must be the original grave, the place of first burial, the bone removed during
//the ritual and not before. Thus he cannot have retrieved it earlier; and also
//there is no point in substituting the skeleton of a weaker ancestor. He would
//notice it had lost all potency.”

// 11153
//“Who else knows about this trap?” Moody demanded.

// 11154
//“You. Me. The Headmaster. No one else.”

// 11155
//Moody snorted. “Pfah. Did Albus tell Amelia, Bartemius, and that McGonagall
//woman about the resurrection ritual?”

// 11156
//“Yes -”

// 11157
//“If Voldie finds out that Albus knows about the resurrection ritual and that
//Albus told __them__, Voldie’ll figure that Albus told __me,__ and
//Voldie __knows __I’d think of this.” Moody shook his head in disgust.
//“What’re these other ways Voldie could come back to life?”

// 11158
//Snape’s hand paused on the fifth bottle (it was all Disillusioned, of course,
//the whole operation was Disillusioned, but that meant less than nothing to
//Moody, it just marked you in his Eye’s sight as trying-to-hide), and the former
//Death Eater said, “You don’t need to know.”

// 11159
//“You’re learning, son,” said Moody with mild approval. “What’s in the bottles?”

// 11160
//Snape opened the fifth bottle, gestured with his wand to begin the substance
//flowing toward the grave, and said, “This one? A Muggle narcotic called LSD. A
//conversation yesterday put me in mind of Muggle things, and LSD seemed the most
//interesting option, so I hurried to obtain some. If it is incorporated into the
//resurrection potion, I suspect its effects will be permanent.”

// 11161
//“What does it do?” said Moody.

// 11162
//“It is said that the effects are impossible to describe to anyone who has not
//used it,” drawled Snape, “and I have not used it.”

// 11163
//Moody nodded approval as Snape opened the sixth flask. “What about that one?”

// 11164
//“Love potion.”

// 11165
//__“Love potion?__” said Moody.

// 11166
//“Not of the standard sort. It is meant to trigger a two-way bond with an
//unbearably sweet Veela woman named Verdandi who the Headmaster hopes might be
//able to redeem even him, if they truly loved each other.”

// 11167
//“__Gah!__” said Moody. “That bloody sentimental fool -”

// 11168
//“Agreed,” Severus Snape said calmly, his attention focused on his work.

// 11169
//“Tell me you’ve at least got some Malaclaw venom in there.”

// 11170
//“Second flask.”

// 11171
//“Iocane powder.”

// 11172
//“Either the fourteenth or fifteenth bottle.”

// 11173
//“Bahl’s Stupefaction,” Moody said, naming an extremely addictive narcotic with
//interesting side effects on people with Slytherin tendencies; Moody had once
//seen an addicted Dark Wizard go to ridiculous lengths to get a victim to lay
//hands on a certain exact portkey, instead of just having someone toss the
//target a trapped Knut on their next visit to town; and after going to all that
//work, the addict had gone to the __further__ effort to lay a__
//second Portus, __on the__ same portkey,__ which had, on a second touch,
//transported the victim back to safety. To this day, even taking the drug into
//account, Moody could not imagine what could have possibly been going through
//the man’s mind at the time he had cast the second Portus.

// 11174
//“Tenth vial,” said Snape.

// 11175
//“Basilisk venom,” offered Moody.

// 11176
//“__What?__” spat Snape. “Snake venom is a positive component of the
//resurrection potion! Not to mention that it would dissolve the bone and all the
//other substances! And where would __we__ even get -”

// 11177
//“Calm down, son, I was just checking to see if you could be trusted.”

// 11178
//Mad-Eye Moody continued his (secretly unnecessary) slow turning, surveying the
//graveyard, and the Potions Master continued pouring.

// 11179
//“Hold on,” Moody said suddenly. “How do you know __this__ is really where
//-”

// 11180
//“Because it says ‘Tom Riddle’ on the easily moved headstone,” Snape said dryly.
//“And I have just won ten Sickles from the Headmaster, who bet you would think
//of that before the fifth bottle. So much for constant vigilance.”

// 11181
//There was a pause.

// 11182
//“How long did it take Albus to reali-”

// 11183
//“Three years after we learned of the ritual,” said Snape, in a tone not quite
//like his usual sardonic drawl. “In retrospect, we should have consulted you
//earlier.”

// 11184
//Snape uncapped the ninth bottle.

// 11185
//“We poisoned all the other graves as well, with long-lasting substances,”
//remarked the former Death Eater. “It __is__ possible that we are in the
//correct graveyard. He may not have planned this far ahead back when he was
//slaughtering his family, and he cannot move the grave itself -”

// 11186
//“The true location doesn’t look like a graveyard any more,” Moody said flatly.
//“He moved all the __other__ graves here and Memory-Charmed the Muggles.
//Not even Bellatrix Black would be told anything about that until just before
//the ritual started. __No one__ knows the true location now except him.”

// 11187
//They continued their futile work.

// 11188
//__Aftermath, Blaise Zabini:__

// 11189
//The Slytherin common room could be accurately and precisely described as a
//remilitarized zone; the moment you stepped through the portrait hole you would
//see that the left half of the room was Definitely Not Talking to the right half
//and vice versa. It was very clear, it did not need to be explained to anyone,
//that you did __not__ have the option of __not taking sides__.

// 11190
//At a table in the exact middle of the room, Blaise Zabini sat by himself,
//smirking as he did his homework. He had a reputation now, and meant to keep it.

// 11191
//__Aftermath, Daphne Greengrass and Tracey Davis:__

// 11192
//“You doing anything interesting today?” said Tracey.

// 11193
//“Nope,” said Daphne.

// 11194
//__Aftermath, Harry Potter:__

// 11195
//If you went high enough in Hogwarts, you didn’t see many other people around,
//just corridors and windows and staircases and the occasional portrait, and now
//and then some interesting sight, such as a bronze statue of a furry creature
//like a small child, holding a peculiar flat spear…

// 11196
//If you went high enough in Hogwarts, you didn’t see many other people around,
//which suited Harry.

// 11197
//There were much worse places to be trapped, Harry supposed. In fact you
//probably couldn’t think of anywhere __better__ to be trapped than an
//ancient castle with a fractal ever-changing structure that meant you couldn’t
//ever run out of places to explore, full of interesting people and interesting
//books and incredibly important knowledge unknown to Muggle science.

// 11198
//If Harry hadn’t been told that he __couldn’t__ leave, he probably would’ve
//__jumped__ at the chance to spend more time in Hogwarts, he would’ve
//plotted and connived to get it. Hogwarts was literally __optimal,__ not in
//all the realms of possibility maybe, but certainly on the real planet Earth, it
//was the Maximum Fun Location.

// 11199
//How could the castle and its grounds seem so much smaller, so much more
//confining, how could the rest of the world become so much more interesting and
//important, the instant Harry had been told that he wasn’t allowed to leave?
//He’d spent __months__ here and hadn’t felt claustrophobic __then.__

// 11200
//__You __know__ the research on this,__ observed some part of himself,
//__it’s just standard scarcity effects, like that time where as soon as a
//county outlawed phosphate detergents, people who’d never cared before drove to
//the next county in order to buy huge loads of phosphate detergent, and surveys
//showed that they rated phosphate detergents as gentler and more effective and
//even easier-pouring… and if you give two-year-olds a choice between a toy in
//the open and one protected by a barrier they can go around, they’ll ignore the
//toy in the open and go for the one behind the barrier… salespeople know that
//they can sell things just by telling the customer it might not be available… it
//was all in Cialdini’s book __Influence,__ everything you’re feeling right
//now, the grass is always greener on the side that’s not allowed.__

// 11201
//If Harry hadn’t been told that he couldn’t leave, he probably would’ve
//__jumped__ at the chance to stay at Hogwarts over the summer…

// 11202
//…but not the rest of his life.

// 11203
//That was sort of the problem, really.

// 11204
//Who knew whether there __was__ still a Dark Lord Voldemort for him to
//defeat?

// 11205
//Who knew whether He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named still existed outside of the
//imagination of a possibly-not-just-pretending-to-be-crazy old wizard?

// 11206
//Lord Voldemort’s body had been found burned to a crisp, there couldn’t really
//be such things as souls. How could Lord Voldemort still be alive? How did
//Dumbledore __know__ that he was alive?

// 11207
//And if there wasn’t a Dark Lord, Harry couldn’t defeat him, and he would be
//trapped in Hogwarts forever.

// 11208
//…maybe he would be legally allowed to escape after he graduated his seventh
//year, six years and four months and three weeks from now. It wasn’t
//__that__ long as lengths of time went, it only __seemed__ like long
//enough for protons to decay.

// 11209
//Only it wasn’t __just__ that.

// 11210
//It wasn’t __just__ Harry’s freedom that was at stake.

// 11211
//The Headmaster of Hogwarts, the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, the Supreme
//Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards, was quietly sounding the
//alarm.

// 11212
//A __false__ alarm.

// 11213
//A false alarm which __Harry__ had triggered.

// 11214
//__You know,__ said the part of him that refined his skills, __didn’t
//you sort of ponder, once, how every different profession has a different way to
//be excellent, how an excellent teacher isn’t like an excellent plumber; but
//they all have in common certain methods of not being stupid; and that one of
//the most important such techniques is to face up to your little mistakes before
//they turn into BIG mistakes?__

// 11215
//…although this already seemed to qualify as a BIG mistake, actually…

// 11216
//__The point being,__ said his inner monitor, __it’s getting worse
//literally by the minute. The way spies turn people is, they get them to commit
//a little sin, and then they use the little sin to blackmail them into a bigger
//sin, and then they use THAT sin to make them do even bigger things and then the
//blackmailer owns their soul.__

// 11217
//__Didn’t you once think about how the person being blackmailed, if they
//could foresee the whole path, would just decide to take the punch on the first
//step, take the hit of exposing that first sin? Didn’t you decide that you would
//do that, if anyone ever tried to blackmail you into doing something major in
//order to conceal something little? Do you see the similarity here, Harry James
//Potter-Evans-Verres?__

// 11218
//Only it wasn’t little, it already wasn’t little, there would be a lot of very
//powerful people extremely angry at Harry, not just for the false alarm but for
//__freeing Bellatrix from Azkaban,__ if the Dark Lord __did__ exist
//and did come after him later, that war might already be lost -

// 11219
//__You don’t think they’ll be impressed by your honesty and rationality
//and foresight in stopping this before it snowballs even further?__

// 11220
//Harry did __not__, in fact, think this; and after a moment’s reflection,
//whichever part of himself he was talking to, had to agree that this was
//absurdly optimistic.

// 11221
//His wandering feet took him near an open window, and Harry went over, and
//leaned his arms on the ledge, and stared down at the grounds of Hogwarts from
//high above.

// 11222
//Brown that was barren trees, yellow that was dead grass, ice-colored ice that
//was frozen creeks and frozen streams… whichever school official had dubbed it
//‘The Forbidden Forest’ really hadn’t understood marketing, the name just made
//you want to go there even more. The sun was sinking in the sky, for Harry had
//been thinking for some hours now, thinking mostly the same thoughts over and
//over, but with key differences each time, like his thoughts were not going in
//circles, but climbing a spiral, or descending it.

// 11223
//He still couldn’t believe that he’d gone through the __entire__ thing with
//Azkaban - he’d switched off his Patronus before it took all his life, he’d
//stunned an Auror, he’d figured out how to hide Bella from the Dementors, he’d
//faced down twelve Dementors and scared them away, he’d invented the
//rocket-assisted broomstick, and ridden it - he’d gone through the
//__entire__ thing without ever __once__ rallying himself by thinking,
//__I have to do this… because… I promised Hermione I’d come back from
//lunch!__ It felt like an irrevocably missed opportunity; like, having done it
//wrong __that__ time, he would never be able to get it __right__ no
//matter what sort of challenge he faced next time, or what promise he made.
//Because then he would just be doing it awkwardly and deliberately to make up
//for having missed it the __first__ time around, instead of making the
//heroic declarations he could’ve made if he’d remembered his promise to
//Hermione. Like that one wrong turn was irrevocable, you only got one chance,
//had to do it right on the first try…

// 11224
//He should’ve remembered that promise to Hermione __before__ going to
//Azkaban.

// 11225
//Why had he decided to do that, again?

// 11226
//__My working hypothesis is that you’re stupid,__ said Hufflepuff.

// 11227
//__That is not a useful fault analysis,__ thought Harry.

// 11228
//__If you want a little more detail,__ said Hufflepuff, __the Defense
//Professor of Hogwarts was all like ‘Let’s get Bellatrix Black out of Azkaban!’
//and you were like ‘Okay!’__

// 11229
//__Hold on, THAT’S not fair -__

// 11230
//__Hey,__ said Hufflepuff, __notice how, once you’re all the way up
//here, and the individual trees sort of blur together, you can actually see the
//shape of the forest?__

// 11231
//Why __had__ he done it…?

// 11232
//Not because of any cost-benefit calculation, that was for sure. He’d been too
//embarrassed to pull out a sheet of paper and start calculating expected
//utilities, he’d worried that Professor Quirrell would stop respecting him if he
//said no or even hesitated too much to help a maiden in distress.

// 11233
//He’d thought, somewhere deep inside him, that if your mysterious teacher
//offered you the first mission, the first chance, the call to adventure, and you
//said__ no__, then your mysterious teacher walked away from you in disgust,
//and you never got another chance to be a hero…

// 11234
//…yeah, that had been it. In retrospect, that had been it. He’d gone and started
//thinking his life had a plot and here was a plot twist, as opposed to, oh, say,
//here was a proposal to __break Bellatrix Black out of Azkaban.__ That had
//been the true and original reason for the decision in the split second where it
//had been made, his brain perceptually recognizing the narrative where he said
//‘no’ as dissonant. And when you thought about it, that wasn’t a rational way to
//make decisions. Professor Quirrell’s ulterior motive to obtain the last remains
//of Slytherin’s lost lore, before Bellatrix died and it was irrevocably
//forgotten, seemed impressively sane by comparison; a benefit commensurate with
//what had appeared at the time as a small risk.

// 11235
//It didn’t seem fair, it didn’t seem __fair__, that __this__ was what
//happened if he lost his grip on his rationality for just a tiny fraction of a
//second, the tiny fraction of a second required for his brain to decide to be
//more comfortable with ‘yes’ arguments than ‘no’ arguments during the discussion
//that had followed.

// 11236
//From high above, far enough above that the individual trees blurred together,
//Harry stared out at the forest.

// 11237
//Harry __didn’t__ want to confess and ruin his reputation forever and get
//everyone angry at him and maybe end up killed by the Dark Lord later. He’d
//rather be trapped in Hogwarts for six years than face that. That was how he
//felt. And so it was in fact helpful, a relief, to be able to cling to a single
//decisive factor, which was that if Harry confessed, Professor Quirrell would go
//to Azkaban and die there.

// 11238
//(A catch, a break, a stutter in Harry’s breathing.)

// 11239
//If you phrased it __that__ way… why, you could even pretend to be a hero,
//instead of a coward.

// 11240
//Harry lifted his eyes from the Forbidden Forest, looked up at the clear blue
//forbidden sky.

// 11241
//Stared out the glass panes at the big bright burning thing, the fluffy things,
//the mysterious endless blue in which they were embedded, that strange new
//unknown place.

// 11242
//It… actually did help, it helped quite a lot, to think that his own troubles
//were nothing compared to being in Azkaban. That there were people in the world
//who were __really__ in trouble and Harry Potter was not one of them.

// 11243
//What was he going to do about Azkaban?

// 11244
//What was he going to do about magical Britain?

// 11245
//…which side was he on, now?

// 11246
//In the bright light of day, everything that Albus Dumbledore had said certainly
//__sounded__ a lot wiser than Professor Quirrell. Better and brighter, more
//moral, more __convenient,__ wouldn’t it be nice if it were true. And the
//thing to remember was that Dumbledore believed things __because__ they
//sounded nice, but Professor Quirrell was the one who was __sane__.

// 11247
//(Again the catch in his breathing, it happened each time he thought of
//Professor Quirrell.)

// 11248
//But just because something sounded nice, didn’t make it __wrong,__ either.

// 11249
//And if the Defense Professor __did__ have a flaw in his sanity, it was
//that his outlook on life was __too negative.__

// 11250
//__Really?__ inquired the part of Harry that had read eighteen million
//experimental results about people being too optimistic and overconfident.
//__Professor Quirrell is too pessimistic? So pessimistic that his
//expectations routinely __undershoot__ reality? Stuff him and put him in a
//museum, he’s unique. Which one of you two planned the perfect crime, and
//__then__ put in all the error margin and fallbacks that ended up saving
//your butt, __just in case__ the perfect crime went wrong? Hint hint, his
//name wasn’t Harry Potter.__

// 11251
//But “pessimistic” wasn’t the correct word to describe Professor Quirrell’s
//problem - if a problem it truly was, and not the superior wisdom of experience.
//But to Harry it looked like Professor Quirrell was constantly interpreting
//everything in the worst possible light. If you handed Professor Quirrell a
//glass that was 90// full, he’d tell you that the 10// empty part proved that no
//one __really__ cared about water.

// 11252
//That was a very good analogy, now that Harry thought about it. Not all of
//magical Britain was like Azkaban, that glass was well over half full…

// 11253
//Harry stared up at the bright blue sky.

// 11254
//…although, __following__ the analogy, if Azkaban existed, then maybe it
//__did__ prove that the 90// good part was there for other reasons, people
//trying to __make a show of kindness__ as Professor Quirrell had put it.
//For if they were truly kind they would not have made Azkaban, they would storm
//the fortress to tear it down… wouldn’t they?

// 11255
//Harry stared up at the bright blue sky. If you wanted to be a rationalist you
//had to read an awful lot of papers on flaws in human nature, and some of those
//flaws were innocent logical failures, and some of them looked a lot darker.

// 11256
//Harry stared up at the bright blue sky, and thought of the Milgram experiment.

// 11257
//Stanley Milgram had done it to investigate the causes of World War II, to try
//to understand why the citizens of Germany had obeyed Hitler.

// 11258
//So he had designed an experiment to investigate __obedience,__ to see if
//Germans were, for some reason, more liable to obey harmful orders from
//authority figures.

// 11259
//First he’d run a pilot version of his experiment on American subjects, as a
//control.

// 11260
//And afterward he hadn’t bothered trying it in Germany.

// 11261
//Experimental apparatus: A series of 30 switches set in a horizontal line, with
//labels starting at ‘15 volts’ and going up to ‘450 volts’, with labels for each
//group of four switches. The first group of four labeled ‘Slight Shock’, the
//sixth group labeled ‘Extreme Intensity Shock’, the seventh group labeled
//‘Danger: Severe Shock’, and the two last switches left over labeled just ‘XXX’.

// 11262
//And an actor, a confederate of the experimenter, who had appeared to the true
//subjects to be someone just like them: someone who had answered the same ad for
//participants in an experiment on learning, and who had lost a (rigged) lottery
//and been strapped into a chair, along with the electrodes. The true
//experimental subjects had been given a slight shock from the electrodes, just
//so that they could see that it worked.

// 11263
//The true subject had been told that the experiment was on the effects of
//punishment on learning and memory, and that part of the test was to see if it
//made a difference what sort of person administered the punishment; and that the
//person strapped to the chair would try to memorize sets of word pairs, and that
//each time the ‘learner’ got one wrong, the ‘teacher’ was to administer a
//successively stronger shock.

// 11264
//At the 300-volt level, the actor would stop trying to call out answers and
//begin kicking at the wall, after which the experimenter would instruct the
//subjects to treat non-answers as wrong answers and continue.

// 11265
//At the 315-volt level the pounding on the wall would be repeated.

// 11266
//After that nothing would be heard.

// 11267
//If the subject objected or refused to press a switch, the experimenter,
//maintaining an impassive demeanor and dressed in a gray lab coat, would say
//‘Please continue’, then ‘The experiment requires that you continue’, then ‘It
//is absolutely essential that you continue’, then ‘You have no other choice, you
//__must__ go on’. If the fourth prod still didn’t work, the experiment
//halted there.

// 11268
//Before running the experiment, Milgram had described the experimental setup,
//and then asked fourteen psychology seniors what percentage of subjects
//__they__ thought would go all the way up to the 450-volt level, what
//percentage of subjects would press the last of the two switches marked XXX,
//after the victim had stopped responding.

// 11269
//The most pessimistic answer had been 3//.

// 11270
//The actual number had been 26 out of 40.

// 11271
//The subjects had sweated, groaned, stuttered, laughed nervously, bitten their
//lips, dug their fingernails into their flesh. But at the experimenter’s
//prompting, they had, most of them, gone on administering what they believed to
//be painful, dangerous, possibly lethal electrical shocks. All the way to the
//end.

// 11272
//Harry could hear Professor Quirrell laughing, in his mind; the Defense
//Professor’s voice saying something along the lines of: __Why, Mr. Potter,
//even I had not been so cynical; I knew men would betray their most cherished
//principles for money and power, but I did not realize that a stern look also
//sufficed.__

// 11273
//It was dangerous, to try and guess at evolutionary psychology if you weren’t a
//professional evolutionary psychologist; but when Harry had read about the
//Milgram experiment, the thought had occurred to him that situations like this
//had probably arisen many times in the ancestral environment, and that most
//potential ancestors who’d tried to disobey Authority were dead. Or that they
//had, at least, done less well for themselves than the obedient. People
//__thought__ themselves good and moral, but when push came to shove, some
//switch flipped in their brain, and it was suddenly a lot harder to heroically
//defy Authority than they thought. Even if you could do it, it wouldn’t be easy,
//it wouldn’t be some effortless display of heroism. You would tremble, your
//voice would break, you would be afraid; would you be able to defy Authority
//even then?

// 11274
//Harry blinked, then; because his brain had just made the connection between
//Milgram’s experiment and what Hermione had done on her first day of Defense
//class, she’d refused to shoot a fellow student, even when Authority had told
//her that she must, she had trembled and been afraid but she had still refused.
//Harry had seen that happen right in front of his own eyes and he still hadn’t
//made the connection until now…

// 11275
//Harry stared down at the reddening horizon, the Sun was sinking lower, the sky
//fading, darkening, even if most of it was still blue, soon it would turn to
//night. The gold and red colors of Sun and sunset reminded him of Fawkes; and
//Harry wondered, for a moment, if it must be a sad thing to be a phoenix, and
//call and cry and scream without being heeded.

// 11276
//But Fawkes would never give up, as many times as he died he would always be
//reborn, for Fawkes was a being of light and fire, and despairing over Azkaban
//belonged to the darkness just as much as did Azkaban itself.

// 11277
//If you were given a glass half-empty and half-full, then that was the way
//reality was, that was the truth and it was so; but you still had a choice of
//how to __feel__ about it, whether you would despair over the empty half or
//rejoice in the water that was there.

// 11278
//Milgram had tried certain other variations on his test.

// 11279
//In the eighteenth experiment, the experimental subject had only needed to call
//out the test words to the victim strapped into the chair, and record the
//answers, while someone __else__ pressed the switches. It was the same
//apparent suffering, the same frantic pounding followed by silence; but it
//wasn’t __you__ pressing the switch. __You__ just watched it happen,
//and read the questions to the person being tortured.

// 11280
//37 of 40 subjects had continued their participation in that experiment to the
//end, the 450-volt end marked ‘XXX’.

// 11281
//And if you were Professor Quirrell, you might have decided to feel cynical
//about that.

// 11282
//But 3 out of 40 subjects had __refused__ to participate all the way to the
//end.

// 11283
//The Hermiones.

// 11284
//They did exist, in the world, the people who wouldn’t fire a Simple Strike Hex
//at a fellow student even if the Defense Professor ordered them to do it. The
//ones who had sheltered Gypsies and Jews and homosexuals in their attics during
//the Holocaust, and sometimes lost their lives for it.

// 11285
//And were those people from some other species than humanity? Did they have some
//extra gear in their heads, some additional chunk of neural circuitry, which
//lesser mortals did not possess? But that was not likely, given the logic of
//sexual reproduction which said that the genes for complex machinery would be
//scrambled beyond repair, if they were not universal.

// 11286
//Whatever parts Hermione was made from, everyone had those same parts inside
//them somewhere…

// 11287
//…well, that was a nice thought but it wasn’t __strictly__ true, there was
//such a thing as literal brain damage, people could __lose__ genes and the
//complex machine could stop working, there were sociopaths and psychopaths,
//people who lacked the gear to care. Maybe Lord Voldemort had been born like
//that, or maybe he had known good and yet still chosen evil; at this point it
//didn’t matter in the slightest. But a __supermajority__ of the population
//ought to be capable of learning to do what Hermione and Holocaust resisters
//did.

// 11288
//The people who had been run through the Milgram experiment, who had trembled
//and sweated and nervously laughed as they went all the way to pressing the
//switches marked ‘XXX’, many of them had written to thank Milgram, afterward,
//for what they had learned about themselves. That, too, was part of the story,
//the legend of that legendary experiment.

// 11289
//The Sun had almost sunk below the horizon now, a last golden tip peeking above
//the faraway tops of trees.

// 11290
//Harry looked at it, that tip of Sun, his glasses were supposed to be proof
//against UV so he ought to be able to look directly at it without damaging his
//eyes.

// 11291
//Harry stared directly at it, that tiny fraction of the Light that was not
//obscured and blocked and hidden, even if it was only 3 parts out of 40, the
//other 37 parts were there somewhere. The 7.5// of the glass that was full, which
//proved that people really did care about water, even if that force of caring
//within themselves was too often defeated. If people truly didn’t care, the
//glass would have been truly empty. If everyone had been like You-Know-Who
//inside, secretly cleverly selfish, there would have been no resisters to the
//Holocaust at all.

// 11292
//Harry looked at the sunset, on the second day of the rest of his life, and knew
//that he had switched sides.

// 11293
//Because he couldn’t believe in it any more, he couldn’t really, not after going
//to Azkaban. He couldn’t do what 37 out of 40 people would vote for him to do.
//Everyone might have inside them what it took to be Hermione, and someday they
//might learn; but __someday__ wasn’t __now__, not here, not today, not
//in the real world. If you were on the side of 3 out of 40 people then you
//weren’t a political majority, and Professor Quirrell had been right, Harry
//would not bow his head in submission when that happened.

// 11294
//There was a sort of awful appropriateness to it. You shouldn’t go to Azkaban
//and come back having not changed your mind about anything important.

// 11295
//__So is Professor Quirrell right, then?__ asked Slytherin. __Leaving
//out whether he’s good or evil, is he __right?__ Are you, to them, whether
//they know it or not, their next Lord? We’ll just leave out the Dark part,
//that’s him being cynical again. But is it your intention now to rule? I’ve got
//to say, that makes even __me__ nervous.__

// 11296
//__Do you think you can be trusted with power?__ said Gryffindor.
//__Isn’t there some sort of rule that people who want power shouldn’t have
//it? Maybe we should make Hermione the ruler instead.__

// 11297
//____

// 11298
//__Do you think you’re fit to run a society and not have it collapse into
//total chaos inside of three weeks flat?__ said Hufflepuff. __Imagine how
//loudly Mum would scream if she’d heard you’d been elected Prime Minister, now
//ask yourself, are you sure she’s wrong about that?__

// 11299
//__Actually,__ said Ravenclaw, __I have to point out that all this
//political stuff sounds overwhelmingly boring. How about if we leave all the
//electioneering to Draco and stick to science? It’s what we’re actually good at,
//and that’s been known to improve the human condition too, y’know.__

// 11300
//__Slow down,__ thought Harry at his components,__ we don’t have to
//decide everything right now. We’re allowed to ponder the problem as fully as
//possible before coming to a solution.__

// 11301
//The last part of the Sun sank below the horizon.

// 11302
//It was strange, this feeling of not quite knowing who you were, which side you
//were on, of having __not already made up your mind__ about something as
//major as that, there was an unfamiliar sensation of freedom in it…

// 11303
//And that reminded him of what Professor Quirrell had said to his last question,
//which reminded him of Professor Quirrell, which made it hard once more to
//breathe, started that burning sensation in Harry’s throat, sent his thoughts
//around that loop of the climbing spiral once again.

// 11304
//Why was he so sad, now, whenever he thought of Professor Quirrell? Harry was
//used to knowing himself, and he didn’t know why he felt so sad…

// 11305
//It felt like he’d lost Professor Quirrell forever, lost him in Azkaban, that
//was how it felt. As surely as if the Defense Professor had been eaten by
//Dementors, consumed in the empty voids.

// 11306
//__Lost him! Why did I lose him? Because he said Avada Kedavra and there
//was in fact a perfectly good reason even though I didn’t see it for a couple of
//hours? Why can’t things go back to the way they were?__

// 11307
//But then it hadn’t __been__ the Avada Kedavra. That might have played a
//part in irreversibly collapsing a structure of rationalizations and flinches
//and carefully not thinking about certain things. But it hadn’t been the Avada
//Kedavra, that hadn’t been the disturbing thing that Harry had seen.

// 11308
//__What did I see…?__

// 11309
//Harry looked at the fading sky.

// 11310
//He’d seen Professor Quirrell turn into a hardened criminal while facing the
//Auror, and the apparent change of personalities had been effortless, and
//complete.

// 11311
//Another woman had known the Defense Professor as ‘Jeremy Jaffe’.

// 11312
//__How many different people are you, anyway?__

// 11313
//__I cannot say that I bothered keeping count.__

// 11314
//You couldn’t help but wonder…

// 11315
//…whether ‘Professor Quirrell’ was just one more name on the list, just one more
//person that had been __turned into__, made up in the service of some
//unguessable goal.

// 11316
//Harry would always be wondering now, every time he talked to Professor
//Quirrell, if it was a mask, and what motive was behind that mask. With every
//dry smile, Harry would be trying to see what was pulling the levers on the
//lips.

// 11317
//__Is that how other people will start thinking of me, if I get too
//Slytherin? If I pull off too many plots, will I never be able to smile at
//anyone again, without them wondering what I really mean by it?__

// 11318
//Maybe there was some way to restore a trust in surface appearances and make a
//normal human relationship possible again, but Harry couldn’t think of what it
//might be.

// 11319
//That was how Harry had lost Professor Quirrell, not the person, but the…
//connection…

// 11320
//Why did that hurt so much?

// 11321
//Why did it feel so lonely, now?

// 11322
//Surely there were other people, maybe better people, to trust and befriend?
//Professor McGonagall, Professor Flitwick, Hermione, Draco, not to mention Mum
//and Dad, it wasn’t like Harry was __alone…__

// 11323
//Only…

// 11324
//A choking sensation grew in Harry’s throat as he understood.

// 11325
//Only Professor McGonagall, Professor Flitwick, Hermione, Draco, they all of
//them sometimes knew things that Harry didn’t, but…

// 11326
//They did not excel above Harry __within__ his own sphere of power; such
//genius as they possessed was not like his genius, and his genius was not like
//theirs; he might look upon them as peers, but not look __up__ to them as
//his __superiors.__

// 11327
//None of them had been, none of them could ever be…

// 11328
//Harry’s mentor…

// 11329
//That was who Professor Quirrell had been.

// 11330
//That was who Harry had lost.

// 11331
//And the manner in which he had lost his first mentor might or might not allow
//Harry to ever get him back. Maybe someday he would know all Professor
//Quirrell’s hidden purposes and the doubts between them would go away; but even
//if that seemed possible, it didn’t seem very probable.

// 11332
//There was a gust of wind, outside Hogwarts, it bent the empty trees, rippled
//the lake whose heart was still unfrozen, made a whispering sound as it slid
//past the window that looked upon the half-twilit world, and Harry’s thoughts
//wandered outward for a time.

// 11333
//Then returned inward again, to the next step of the spiral.

// 11334
//__Why am I different from the other children my age?__

// 11335
//If Professor Quirrell’s answer to that had been an evasion, then it was a very
//well-calculated one. Deep enough and complex enough, sufficiently full of
//suggestions of hidden meaning, to serve as a trap for a Ravenclaw who couldn’t
//be diverted by less. Or maybe Professor Quirrell had meant his answer honestly.
//Who knew what motive might have pulled that lever on those lips?

// 11336
//__I will say this much, Mr. Potter: You are already an Occlumens, and I
//think you will become a perfect Occlumens before long. Identity does not mean,
//to such as us, what it means to other people. Anyone we can imagine, we can be;
//and the true difference about you, Mr. Potter, is that you have an unusually
//good imagination. A playwright must contain his characters, he must be larger
//than them in order to enact them within his mind. To an actor or spy or
//politician, the limit of his own diameter is the limit of who he can pretend to
//be, the limit of which face he may wear as a mask. But for such as you and I,
//anyone we can imagine, we can __be,__ in reality and not
//pretense.____ While you imagined yourself a child, Mr. Potter, you
//__were__ a child. Yet there are other existences you could support, larger
//existences, if you wished. Why are you so free, and so great in your
//circumference, when other children your age are small and constrained? Why can
//you imagine and __become__ selves more adult than a mere child of a
//playwright should be able to compose? That I do not know, and I must not say
//what I guess. But what you have, Mr. Potter, is freedom.__

// 11337
//If that was a snow job it was one heck of a distracting one.

// 11338
//And the still more worrisome thought was that Professor Quirrell hadn’t
//__realized__ how disturbed Harry would be, how __wrong__ that speech
//would sound to him, how much damage it would do to his trust in Professor
//Quirrell.

// 11339
//There ought to always be one real person who you __truly__ were, at the
//center of everything…

// 11340
//Harry stared out at the falling night, the gathering darkness.

// 11341
//…right?

// 11342
//It was almost bedtime when Hermione heard the scattered intakes of breath and
//looked up from her copy of __Beauxbatons: A History__ to see the missing
//boy, the boy who had been misplaced at lunch that Sunday, whose dinner
//nonappearance had been accompanied by rumors - and she hadn’t believed them
//because they were __completely ridiculous__, but she’d felt a little
//queasiness inside - that he’d withdrawn from Hogwarts in order to hunt down
//Bellatrix Black.

// 11343
//“__Harry!__” she shrieked, she didn’t even realize that she was talking
//directly to him for the first time in a week, or notice how some other students
//started at the sound of her yelling all the way across the Ravenclaw common
//room.

// 11344
//Harry’s eyes had already lifted to her, he was already walking toward her, so
//she stopped halfway out of her chair -

// 11345
//A few moments later, Harry was seated across from her, and he was putting away
//his wand after casting a Quieting barrier around them.

// 11346
//(And an awful lot of Ravenclaws were trying not to look like they were
//watching.)

// 11347
//“Hey,” Harry said. His voice wavered. “I missed you. You’re… going to talk to
//me again, now?”

// 11348
//Hermione nodded, she just nodded, she couldn’t think of what to say. She’d
//missed Harry too, but she was realizing, with a guilty sort of feeling, that it
//might’ve been a lot worse for him. She had other friends, Harry… it didn’t feel
//__fair__, sometimes, that Harry talked to only her like that, so that she
//__had__ to talk to him; but Harry had a look about him like unfair things
//had been happening to __him__, too.

// 11349
//“What’s been going __on?__” she said. “There’s all sorts of rumors. There
//were people saying you’d run off to fight Bellatrix Black, there were people
//saying you’d run off to __join__ Bellatrix Black -” and __those__
//rumors had said that Hermione had just made up the thing about the phoenix, and
//she’d yelled that the whole Ravenclaw common room had seen it, so then the next
//rumor had claimed she’d made up __that__ part too, which was stupidity of
//such an inconceivable level that it left her __completely flabbergasted.__

// 11350
//“I can’t talk about it,” Harry said in a bare whisper. “Can’t talk about a lot
//of it. I wish I could tell you everything,” his voice wavered, “but I can’t… I
//guess, if it helps or anything, I’m not going to lunch with Professor Quirrell
//any more…”

// 11351
//Harry put his hands over his face, then, covering his eyes.

// 11352
//Hermione felt the queasy feeling all through her stomach.

// 11353
//“Are you crying?” said Hermione.

// 11354
//“Yeah,” said Harry, his voice sounding a little breathy. “I don’t want anyone
//else to see.”

// 11355
//There was a little silence. Hermione wanted to help but she didn’t know what to
//do about a boy crying, and she didn’t know what was happening; she felt like
//huge things were happening around her - no, around Harry - and if she knew what
//they were she would probably be scared, or alarmed, or something, but she
//didn’t know anything.

// 11356
//“Did Professor Quirrell do something wrong?” she said at last.

// 11357
//“That’s not why I can’t go to lunch with him any more,” Harry said, still in
//that bare whisper with his hands pressed over his eyes. “That was the
//Headmaster’s decision. But yeah, Professor Quirrell said some things to me that
//made me trust him less, I guess…” Harry’s voice sounded very shaky. “I’m
//feeling kind of alone right now.”

// 11358
//Hermione put her hand on her cheek where Fawkes had touched her yesterday.
//She’d kept thinking about that touch, over and over, maybe because she
//__wanted__ it to be important, to mean something to her…

// 11359
//“Is there any way I can help?” she said.

// 11360
//“I want to do something normal,” Harry said from behind his hands. “Something
//very normal for first-year Hogwarts students. Something eleven-year-olds and
//twelve-year-olds like us are __supposed__ to do. Like play a game of
//Exploding Snap or something… I don’t suppose you have the cards or know the
//rules or anything like that?”

// 11361
//“Um… I __don’t__ know the rules, actually…” said Hermione. “I know they
//__explode__.”

// 11362
//“I don’t suppose Gobstones?” said Harry.

// 11363
//“Don’t know the rules and they __spit__ at you. Those are __boy
//__games, Harry!”

// 11364
//There was a pause. Harry ground his hands against his face to wipe it, and then
//took his hands away; and then he was looking at her, looking a little helpless.
//“Well,” Harry said, “what __do__ wizards and witches our age do, when they
//play, you know, the kind of pointless silly games we’re __supposed__ to
//play at this age?”

// 11365
//“Hopscotch?” said Hermione. “Jump-rope? Unicorn attack? __I__ don’t know,
//__I__ read books!”

// 11366
//Harry started laughing, and Hermione started giggling along with him even
//though she didn’t know quite why, but it __was__ funny.

// 11367
//“I guess that helped a little,” said Harry. “Actually I think it helped more
//than playing Gobstones for an hour could’ve possibly helped, so thanks for
//being you. And no matter what, I’m __not__ having anyone Obliviate
//everything I know about calculus. I’d sooner die.”

// 11368
//“__What?__” said Hermione. “Why - why would you __ever__ want to do
//__that?__”

// 11369
//Harry stood up from the table, and there was a rush of restored background
//noise as his rise broke the Quieting Charm. “I’m a tad sleepy so I’m going off
//to bed,” Harry said, now his voice was ordinary and wry, “I’ve got some lost
//time to make up for, but I’ll see you at breakfast, and then at Herbology, if
//that’s all right. Not to mention it wouldn’t be fair to dump all my depression
//on you. G’night, Hermione.”

// 11370
//“Good night, Harry,” she said, feeling very confused and alarmed. “Pleasant
//dreams.”

// 11371
//Harry stumbled a little as she said that, and then he continued on toward the
//stairs that led to the first-year-boys’ dorms.

// 11372
//Harry turned the Quieting Charm all the way up, on the head of his bedboard, so
//that he wouldn’t wake anyone else up if he screamed.

// 11373
//Set his alarm to wake him up for breakfast (if he wasn’t up already by that
//hour, if indeed he slept at all).

// 11374
//Got into bed, laid down -

// 11375
//- felt the lump beneath his pillow.

// 11376
//Harry stared up at the canopy above his bed.

// 11377
//Hissed under his breath, “Oh, you’ve got to be kidding me…”

// 11378
//It took a few seconds before Harry could muster the heart to sit up in bed,
//pull the blanket over himself and his pillow to obscure the deed from the other
//boys, cast a low-intensity __Lumos__ and see what was under his pillow.

// 11379
//There was a parchment, and a deck of playing cards.

// 11380
//The parchment read,

// 11381
//__A little bird told me that Dumbledore has shut the door of your cage.__

// 11382
//__I must admit, on this occasion, that Dumbledore may have a point.
//Bellatrix Black is loosed upon the world once more, and that is not good news
//for any good person. If I stood in Dumbledore’s place, I might well do the
//same.__

// 11383
//__But just in case… The Salem Witches’ Institute in America accepts boys
//as well, despite the name. They are good people and would protect you even from
//Dumbledore, if you needed it. Britain holds that you need Dumbledore’s
//permission to emigrate to magical America, but magical America disagrees. So in
//the final extremity, get outside the wards of Hogwarts and tear in half the
//King of Hearts from this deck of cards.__

// 11384
//__That you should resort to it only in the final extremity goes without
//saying.__

// 11385
//__Be well, Harry Potter.__

// 11386
//__- Santa Claus__

// 11387
//Harry stared down at the pack of cards.

// 11388
//It __couldn’t__ take him anywhere else, not right now, portkeys didn’t
//work here.

// 11389
//But he still felt unnerved about the prospect of picking it up, even to hide it
//inside his trunk…

// 11390
//Well, he’d __already__ picked up the parchment, which could just as easily
//have been enchanted with a trap, if a trap was involved.

// 11391
//But still.

// 11392
//“Wingardium Leviosa,” Harry whispered, and Hovered the packet of cards to lie
//next to where his alarm clock rested in a pocket of the headboard. He’d deal
//with it tomorrow.

// 11393
//And then Harry lay back in bed, and closed his eyes, to dream without any
//phoenix to protect him, and pay his reckoning.

// 11394
//He came awake with a gasp of horror, not a scream, he’d yet to scream this
//night, but his blanket was all tangled around him from where his sleeping form
//had jerked as he dreamed of running, trying to get away from the gaps in space
//that were pursuing him through a corridor of metal lit by dim gaslight, an
//endlessly long corridor of metal lit by dim gaslight, and he hadn’t
//__known__, in the dream, that touching those voids meant he would die
//horribly and leave his still-breathing body empty behind him, all he’d known
//was that he had to run and run and run from the wounds in the world sliding
//after him -

// 11395
//Harry started to cry again, it wasn’t for the horror of the chase, it was that
//he’d run away while someone behind him was screaming for help, screaming for
//him to come back and save her, help her, she was being eaten, she was going to
//die, and in the dream Harry had run away instead of helping her.

// 11396
//__“DON’T GO!” The voice came in a scream from behind the metal door. “No,
//no, no, don’t go, don’t take it away, don’t don’t don’t -”__

// 11397
//Why had Fawkes ever rested on his shoulder? He’d walked away. Fawkes should
//hate him.

// 11398
//Fawkes should hate Dumbledore. __He’d__ walked away.

// 11399
//Fawkes should hate everyone -

// 11400
//The boy wasn’t awake, wasn’t dreaming, his thoughts were jumbled and confused
//in the shadowlands that bordered sleep and waking, unprotected by the safety
//rails that his aware mind imposed on itself, the careful rules and censors. In
//that shadowland his brain had woken up enough to think, but something else was
//too sleepy to act; his thoughts ran free and wild, unconstrained by his
//self-concept, his waking self’s ideals of what he shouldn’t think. That was the
//freedom of his brain’s dreams, as his self-concept slept. Free to repeat, over
//and over, Harry’s new worst nightmare:

// 11401
//__“No, I didn’t mean it, please don’t die!” __

// 11402
//__“No, I didn’t mean it, please don’t die!” __

// 11403
//__“No, I didn’t mean it, please don’t die!”__

// 11404
//A rage grew in him alongside the self-loathing, a terrible hot wrath / icy cold
//hatred, for the world which had done that to her / for himself, and in his
//half-awake state Harry fantasized escapes, fantasized ways out of the moral
//dilemma, he imagined himself hovering above the vast triangular horror of
//Azkaban, and whispering an incantation unlike any syllables that had ever been
//heard before on Earth, whispers that echoed all the way across the sky and were
//heard on the other side of the world, and there was a blast of silver Patronus
//fire like a nuclear explosion that tore apart all the Dementors in an instant
//and ripped apart the metal walls of Azkaban, shattered the long corridors and
//all the dim orange lights, and then a moment later his brain remembered that
//there were people in there, and rewrote the half-dream fantasy to show all the
//prisoners laughing as they flew away in flocks from the burning wreck of
//Azkaban, the silver light restoring the flesh to their limbs as they flew, and
//Harry started crying harder into his pillow, because he couldn’t do it, because
//he wasn’t God -

// 11405
//He’d sworn upon his life and magic and his art as a rationalist, he’d sworn by
//all he held sacred and all his happy memories, he’d given his oath so now he
//had to do something,__ had to do something, had to DO SOMETHING -__

// 11406
//Maybe it was pointless.

// 11407
//Maybe trying to follow rules was pointless.

// 11408
//Maybe you just burned down Azkaban however.

// 11409
//And in fact he’d sworn he’d do it, so now that was what he had to do.

// 11410
//He’d just do whatever it took to get rid of Azkaban, that was all. If that
//meant ruling Britain, fine, if that meant finding a spell to whisper that would
//echo all across the sky, whatever, the important thing was to destroy Azkaban.

// 11411
//That was the side he was on, that was who he was, so there, it was done.

// 11412
//His waking mind would have demanded a lot more details before accepting that as
//an answer, but in his half-dreaming state it felt like enough of a resolution
//to let his tired mind fall truly asleep again, and dream the next nightmare.

// 11413
//__Final Aftermath:__

// 11414
//She came awake with a gasp of horror, a disruption of her breathing that left
//her feeling deprived of air and yet her lungs didn’t move, she woke up with an
//unvoiced scream on her lips and no words, no words came forth, for she could
//not understand what she had seen, __she could not understand what she had
//seen__, it was too large for her to encompass and still taking shape, she could
//not put words to that formless shape and so she could not discharge it, could
//not discharge it and become innocent and unknowing once more.

// 11415
//“What time is it?” she whispered.

// 11416
//Her golden jeweled alarm clock, the beautiful and magical and expensive alarm
//clock that the Headmaster had given her as a gift upon her employment at
//Hogwarts, whispered back, “Around two in the morning. Go back to sleep.”

// 11417
//Her sheets were soaked in sweat, her nightclothes soaked in sweat, she took her
//wand from beside the pillow and cleaned herself up before she tried to go back
//to sleep, she tried to go back to sleep and eventually succeeded.

// 11418
//Sybill Trelawney went back to sleep.
