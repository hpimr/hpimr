//== Coordination Problems, Pt 3

// 7015
//They had gone to the Defense Professor’s office, and Professor Quirrell had
//sealed the door before he leaned back in his chair and spoke.

// 7016
//The Defense Professor’s voice was very calm, and that unnerved Harry a good
//deal more than if Professor Quirrell had been shouting.

// 7017
//“I am trying,” said Professor Quirrell quietly, “to make allowances for the
//fact that you are young. That I myself, at the same age, was a quite
//extraordinary fool. You speak with adult style and meddle in adult games, and
//sometimes I forget that you are only a meddler. I hope, Mr. Potter, that your
//childish meddling has not just killed you, ruined your country, and lost the
//next war.”

// 7018
//It was very hard for Harry to control his breathing. “Professor Quirrell, I
//said a good deal less than I wished to say, but I had to say something. Your
//proposals are extremely alarming to anyone who has the slightest familiarity
//with Muggle history over the last century. The Italian fascists, some very
//nasty people, got their name from the __fasces,__ a bundle of rods bound
//together to symbolize the idea that unity is strength -”

// 7019
//“So the nasty Italian fascists believed that unity is stronger than division,”
//said Professor Quirrell. Sharpness was beginning to creep into his voice.
//“Perhaps they also believed that the sky is blue, and advocated a policy of not
//dropping rocks on your head.”

// 7020
//__Reversed stupidity is not intelligence; the world’s stupidest person
//may say the sun is shining, but that doesn’t make it dark out…__ “Fine, you’re
//right, that was an ad hominem argument, it’s not wrong __because__ the
//fascists said it. But Professor Quirrell, you can’t have everyone in a country
//take the Mark of one dictator! It’s a single point of failure! Look, I’ll put
//it this way. Suppose the enemy just Imperiuses whoever controls the Mark -”

// 7021
//“Powerful wizards are not so easy to Imperius,” said Professor Quirrell dryly.
//“And if you cannot find a worthy leader, you are in any case doomed. But worthy
//leaders do exist; the question is whether the people shall follow them.”

// 7022
//Harry raked his hands through his hair in frustration. He wanted to call a
//time-out and make Professor Quirrell read __The Rise and Fall of the
//Third Reich__ and then start the conversation over again. “I don’t suppose that
//if I suggested democracy was a better form of government than dictatorship -”

// 7023
//“I see,” said Professor Quirrell. His eyes closed briefly, then opened. “Mr.
//Potter, the stupidity of Quidditch is transparent to you because you did not
//grow up revering the game. If you had never heard of elections, Mr. Potter, and
//you simply __saw what is there__, what you saw would not please you. Look
//to our elected Minister of Magic. Is he the wisest, the strongest, the greatest
//of our nation? No; he is a buffoon who is owned in fee simple by Lucius Malfoy.
//Wizards went to the polls and chose between Cornelius Fudge and Tania Leach,
//who had competed with each other in a grand and entertaining contest after the
//__Daily Prophet,__ which Lucius Malfoy also controls, decided that they
//were the only serious candidates. That Cornelius Fudge was genuinely selected
//as the best leader our country could offer is not a suggestion anyone could
//make with a straight face. It is no different in the Muggle world, from what I
//have heard and seen; the last Muggle newspaper I read mentioned that the
//previous President of the United States had been a retired movie actor. If you
//had not grown up with elections, Mr. Potter, they would be as transparently
//silly to you as Quidditch.”

// 7024
//Harry sat there with his mouth open, struggling for words. “The point of
//elections isn’t to produce the one best leader, it’s to keep politicians scared
//enough of the voters that they don’t go completely evil like dictators do -”

// 7025
//“The last war, Mr. Potter, was fought between the Dark Lord and Dumbledore. And
//while Dumbledore was a flawed leader who was losing the war, it is
//__ridiculous__ to suggest that __any__ of the Ministers of Magic
//elected during that period could have taken Dumbledore’s place! Strength flows
//from powerful wizards and their followers, not from elections and the fools
//they elect. That is the lesson of magical Britain’s recent history; and I doubt
//that the next war will teach you a lesson any different. __If__ you
//survive it, Mr. Potter, which you will __not__ do unless you abandon the
//enthusiastic illusions of childhood!”

// 7026
//“If you think there are no dangers in the course of action you advocate,” said
//Harry, and despite everything his voice was growing sharp, “then that, too, is
//childish enthusiasm.”

// 7027
//Harry stared grimly into Professor Quirrell’s eyes, who stared back without
//blinking.

// 7028
//“Such dangers,” said Professor Quirrell coldly, “are to be discussed in offices
//like this one, not in speeches. The fools who elected Cornelius Fudge are not
//interested in complications and caution. Present them with anything more
//nuanced than a rousing cheer, and you will face your war alone. __That__,
//Mr. Potter, was your childish error, which Draco Malfoy would not have made
//even when he was eight years old. It should have been obvious even to
//__you__ that you should have stayed silent, and __consulted with me
//first__, not spoken your worries before the crowd!”

// 7029
//“I am no friend of Albus Dumbledore,” said Harry, a cold in his voice to match
//Professor Quirrell’s. “But he is no child, and he did not seem to think my
//concerns were childish, nor that I should have waited to speak them.”

// 7030
//“Oh,” said Professor Quirrell, “so you take your cues from the Headmaster now,
//do you?” and stood up from behind his desk.

// 7031
//When Blaise turned the corner on the way to the office, he saw that Professor
//Quirrell was already leaning against the wall.

// 7032
//“Blaise Zabini,” said the Defense Professor, straightening; his eyes were set
//like dark stones within his face, and his voice sent a shiver of fear down
//Blaise’s spine.

// 7033
//__He can’t do anything against me, I just have to remember that -__

// 7034
//“I believe,” said Professor Quirrell, in a clear, cold voice, “that I have
//already guessed the name of your employer. But I would hear it from your own
//lips, and tell me also the price that bought you.”

// 7035
//Blaise knew he was sweating under his robes, and that the moisture would be
//already visible on his forehead. “I got a chance to show I was better than all
//three generals, and I took it. A lot of people hate me now, but there’re also
//plenty of Slytherins who’ll love me for it. What makes you think I’m -”

// 7036
//“You did not devise the plan of today’s battle, Mr. Zabini. Tell me who did.”

// 7037
//Blaise swallowed hard. “Well… I mean, in that case… then you already know who
//did, right? The only one who’s that crazy is Dumbledore. And he’ll protect me
//if you try to do anything.”

// 7038
//“Indeed. Tell me the price.” The Defense Professor’s eyes were still hard.

// 7039
//“It’s my cousin Kimberly,” Blaise said, swallowing again and trying to control
//his voice. “She’s real, and she’s really being bullied, Potter checked that, he
//wasn’t dumb. Only Dumbledore said that he’d nudged the bullies into doing it,
//just for the plan, and if I worked for __him__ she’d be fine afterward,
//but if I __did__ go with Potter, there was more trouble Kimberly could get
//into!”

// 7040
//Professor Quirrell was silent for a long moment.

// 7041
//“I see,” Professor Quirrell said, his voice now much milder. “Mr. Zabini,
//should such an event occur again, you may contact me directly. I have my own
//ways of protecting my friends. Now, a final question: Even with all the power
//you took into your hands, forcing a tie would have been difficult. Did
//Dumbledore instruct you as to who should win otherwise?”

// 7042
//“Sunshine,” said Blaise.

// 7043
//Professor Quirrell nodded. “As I thought.” The Defense Professor sighed. “In
//your future career, Mr. Zabini, I do not suggest trying any plots that
//complicated. They have a tendency to fail.”

// 7044
//“Um, I said that to the Headmaster, actually,” Blaise said, “and he said that
//was why it was important to have more than one plot going at a time.”

// 7045
//Professor Quirrell passed a weary hand across his forehead. “It’s a wonder the
//Dark Lord didn’t go mad from fighting __him.__ You may go on to your
//meeting with the Headmaster, Mr. Zabini. I will say nothing of this, but if the
//Headmaster should somehow discover that we have spoken, remember my standing
//offer to give you what protection I can. You are dismissed.”

// 7046
//Blaise didn’t wait for any other word, just turned and fled.

// 7047
//Professor Quirrell waited for a time, and then said, “Go ahead, Mr. Potter.”

// 7048
//Harry tore the Cloak of Invisibility off his head and stuffed into his pouch.
//He was trembing with so much rage he could hardly speak. “He __what?__ He
//did __what?__”

// 7049
//“You should have deduced it yourself, Mr. Potter,” Professor Quirrell said
//mildly. “You must learn to blur your vision until you can see the forest
//obscured by the trees. Anyone who heard the stories about you, and who did not
//know that you were the mysterious Boy-Who-Lived, could easily deduce your
//ownership of an invisibility cloak. Step back from these events, blur away
//their details, and what do we observe? There was a great rivalry between
//students, and their competition ended in a perfect tie. That sort of thing only
//happens in stories, Mr. Potter, and there is one person in this school who
//thinks in stories. There was a strange and complicated plot, which you should
//have realized was uncharacteristic of the young Slytherin you faced. But there
//is a person in this school who deals in plots that elaborate, and his name is
//not Zabini. And I did warn you that there was a quadruple agent; you knew that
//Zabini was at least a triple agent, and you should have guessed a high chance
//that it was he. No, I will not declare the battle invalid. All three of you
//failed the test, and lost to your common enemy.”

// 7050
//Harry didn’t care about tests at this point. “Dumbledore __blackmailed__
//Zabini by __threatening his cousin?__ Just to make our battle end in a
//tie? __Why?__”

// 7051
//Professor Quirrell gave a mirthless laugh. “Perhaps the Headmaster thought the
//rivalry was good for his pet hero and wished to see it continue. For the
//greater good, you understand. Or perhaps he was simply mad. You see, Mr.
//Potter, everyone knows that Dumbledore’s madness is a mask, that he is sane
//pretending to be insane. They pride themselves on that clever insight, and
//knowing the secret explanation, they stop looking. It does not occur to them
//that it is __also__ possible to have a mask behind the mask, to be insane
//pretending to be sane pretending to be insane. And I am afraid, Mr. Potter,
//that I have urgent business elsewhere, and must depart; but I should strongly
//advise you not to take your cues from Albus Dumbledore when fighting a war.
//Until later, Mr. Potter.”

// 7052
//And the Defense Professor inclined his head with some irony, and then strode
//off in the same direction Zabini had fled, while Harry was still standing in
//open-mouthed shock.

// 7053
//__Aftermath: Harry Potter.__

// 7054
//Harry trudged slowly toward the Ravenclaw dorm, eyes unseeing of walls,
//paintings, or other students; he went up stairs and down ramps without slowing,
//speeding, or noticing where he trod.

// 7055
//It had taken him more than a minute after Professor Quirrell’s departure to
//realize that his only source of information about Dumbledore being involved was
//(a) Blaise Zabini, who he would have to be an absolute gaping idiot to trust
//again, and (b) Professor Quirrell, who could have easily faked a plot in
//Dumbledore’s style, and who might also think that a little student rivalry was
//a fine thing; and who had, if you stepped back and blurred out the details,
//just proposed turning the country into a magical dictatorship.

// 7056
//And it was also possible that Dumbledore __was__ the one behind Zabini,
//and that Professor Quirrell had been sincerely trying to fight the Dark Mark in
//kind, and prevent the repetition of a performance he saw as pathetic. Trying to
//make sure that Harry didn’t end up fighting the Dark Lord alone, while everyone
//else hid, frightened, trying to stay out of the line of fire, waiting for Harry
//to save them.

// 7057
//But the truth was…

// 7058
//Well…

// 7059
//Harry was sort of okay with that.

// 7060
//It was, he knew, the kind of thing that was supposed to make heroes resentful
//and bitter.

// 7061
//To heck with that. Harry was very much in favor of everyone else
//__staying out of danger__ while the Boy-Who-Lived took down the Dark Lord
//by himself, plus or minus a small number of companions. If the next conflict
//with the Dark Lord got to the point of a Second Wizarding War that killed lots
//of people and embroiled a whole country, that would mean Harry had
//__already failed__.

// 7062
//And if afterward a war broke out between wizards and Muggles, it didn’t matter
//who won, Harry would have already failed by letting it get that far. Besides,
//who said the societies couldn’t peacefully integrate when the secrecy
//inevitably broke down? (Though Harry could hear Professor Quirrell’s dry voice
//in his mind, asking him if he was a fool, and saying all the obvious things…)
//And if mages and Muggles couldn’t live in peace, then Harry would combine magic
//and science and figure out how to evacuate all the wizards to Mars or
//somewhere, instead of letting a war break out.

// 7063
//Because if it did come down to a war of extermination…

// 7064
//That was the thing Professor Quirrell hadn’t realized, the one most important
//question he’d forgotten to ask his young general.

// 7065
//The real reason why Harry had no intention of being argued into endorsing a
//Light Mark, no matter __how__ much it would help him in his fight against
//the Dark Lord.

// 7066
//One Dark Lord and fifty Marked followers had been a peril to all of magical
//Britain.

// 7067
//If all Britain took the Mark of a strong leader, they would be a peril to the
//whole magical world.

// 7068
//And if the whole wizarding world took a single Mark, they would be a danger to
//the rest of humanity.

// 7069
//No one knew quite how many wizards there were in the world. He’d done a few
//estimates with Hermione and come up with numbers in the rough range of a
//million.

// 7070
//But there were six billion Muggles.

// 7071
//If it came down to a final war…

// 7072
//Professor Quirrell had forgotten to ask Harry which side he would protect.

// 7073
//A scientific civilization, reaching outward, looking upward, knowing that its
//destiny was to grasp the stars.

// 7074
//And a magical civilization, slowly fading as knowledge was lost, still governed
//by a nobility that saw Muggles as not quite human.

// 7075
//It was a terribly sad feeling, but not one that held any hint of doubt.

// 7076
//__Aftermath: Blaise Zabini.__

// 7077
//Blaise strolled through the hallways with careful, self-imposed slowness, his
//heart beating wildly as he tried to calm down -

// 7078
//“Ahem,” said a dry, whispering voice from a shadowy alcove as he passed.

// 7079
//Blaise jumped, but he didn’t scream.

// 7080
//Slowly, he turned.

// 7081
//In that small, shadowy corner was a black cloak so wide and billowing that it
//was impossible to determine whether the figure beneath was male or female, and
//atop the cloak a broad-brimmed black hat, and a black mist seemed to gather
//beneath it and obscure the face of whoever or whatever might lie beneath.

// 7082
//“Report,” whispered Mr. Hat and Cloak.

// 7083
//“I said just what you told me to,” said Blaise. His voice was a little calmer
//now that he wasn’t lying to anyone. “And Professor Quirrell reacted just the
//way you expected.”

// 7084
//The broad black hat tilted and straightened, as though the head below had
//nodded. “Excellent,” said the unidentifiable whisper. “The reward I promised
//you is already on its way to your mother, by owl.”

// 7085
//Blaise hesitated, but his curiosity was eating him alive. “Can I ask now why
//you want to cause trouble between Professor Quirrell and Dumbledore?” The
//Headmaster hadn’t had anything to do with the Gryffindor bullies that Blaise
//knew about, and besides helping Kimberly, the Headmaster had also offered to
//make Professor Binns give him excellent marks in History of Magic even if he
//turned in blank parchments for his homework, though he’d still have to attend
//class and pretend to hand them in. Actually Blaise would have betrayed all
//three generals for free, and never mind his cousin either, but he’d seen no
//need to say that.

// 7086
//The broad black hat cocked to one side, as if to convey a quizzical stare.
//“Tell me, friend Blaise, did it occur to you that traitors who betray so many
//times over often meet with ill ends?”

// 7087
//“Nope,” said Blaise, looking straight into the black mist under the hat.
//“Everyone knows that nothing __really__ bad ever happens to students in
//Hogwarts.”

// 7088
//Mr. Hat and Cloak gave a whispery chuckle. “Indeed,” said the whisper. “With
//the murder of one student five decades ago being the exception that proves the
//rule, since Salazar Slytherin would have keyed his monster into the ancient
//wards at a higher level than the Headmaster himself.”

// 7089
//Blaise stared at the black mist, now beginning to feel a little uneasy. But it
//ought to take a Hogwarts professor to do anything significant to him without
//setting off alarms. Quirrell and Snape were the only professors who’d do
//something like this, and Quirrell wouldn’t care about fooling __himself__,
//and Snape wouldn’t hurt one of his own Slytherins… would he?

// 7090
//“No, friend Blaise,” whispered the black mist, “I only wished to advise you
//never to try anything like this in your adult life. So many betrayals would
//certainly lead to at least one vengeance.”

// 7091
//“My __mother__ never got any vengeances,” said Blaise proudly. “Even
//though she married __seven__ husbands and every single one of them died
//mysteriously and left her lots of money.”

// 7092
//“Really?” said the whisper. “However did she persuade the seventh to marry her
//after he heard what happened to the first six?”

// 7093
//“I asked Mum that,” said Blaise, “and she said I couldn’t know until I was old
//enough, and I asked her how old was old enough, and she said, older than her.”

// 7094
//Again the whispery chuckle. “Well then, friend Blaise, my congratulations on
//having followed in your mother’s footsteps. Go, and if you say nothing of this,
//we will not meet again.”

// 7095
//Blaise backed uneasily away, feeling an odd reluctance to turn his back.

// 7096
//The hat tilted. “Oh, come now, little Slytherin. If you were truly the equal of
//Harry Potter or Draco Malfoy, you would have already realized that my hinted
//threats were just to ensure your silence before Albus. Had I intended to harm,
//I would not have hinted; had I said nothing, __then__ you should have
//worried.”

// 7097
//Blaise straightened, feeling a little insulted, and nodded to Mr. Hat and
//Cloak; then turned decisively and strode off toward his meeting with the
//Headmaster.

// 7098
//He’d been hoping to the very end that someone __else__ would show up and
//give him a chance to sell out Mr. Hat and Cloak.

// 7099
//But then Mum hadn’t betrayed seven different husbands at the __same
//time.__ When you looked at it __that__ way, he was still doing better than
//her.

// 7100
//And Blaise Zabini went on walking toward the Headmaster’s office, smiling,
//content to be a quintuple agent -

// 7101
//For a moment the boy stumbled, but then straightened, shaking off the odd
//feeling of disorientation.

// 7102
//And Blaise Zabini went on walking toward the Headmaster’s office, smiling,
//content to be a quadruple agent.

// 7103
//__Aftermath: Hermione Granger.__

// 7104
//The messenger didn’t approach her until she was alone.

// 7105
//Hermione was just leaving the girl’s bathroom where she sometimes hid to think,
//and a bright shining cat leaped out of nowhere and said, “Miss Granger?”

// 7106
//She let out a little shriek before she realized the cat had spoken in Professor
//McGonagall’s voice.

// 7107
//Even so she hadn’t been frightened, only startled; the cat was bright and
//brilliant and beautiful, glowing with a white silver radiance like moon-colored
//sunlight, and she couldn’t imagine being scared.

// 7108
//“What are you?” said Hermione.

// 7109
//“This is a message from Professor McGonagall,” said the cat, still in the
//Professor’s voice. “Can you come to my office, and not speak of this to
//anyone?”

// 7110
//“I’ll be there right away,” said Hermione, still surprised, and the cat leaped
//and vanished; only it didn’t vanish, it traveled away somehow; or that was what
//her mind said, even though her eyes just saw it disappear.

// 7111
//By the time Hermione had got to the office of her favorite professor, her mind
//was all a-whirl with speculations. Was there something wrong with her
//Transfiguration scores? But then why would Professor McGonagall say not to tell
//anyone? It was probably about Harry practicing his partial Transfiguration…

// 7112
//Professor McGonagall’s face looked worried, not stern, as Hermione seated
//herself in front of the desk - trying to keep her eyes from going to the nest
//of cubbyholes containing Professor McGonagall’s homework, she’d always wondered
//what sort of work grownups had to do to keep the school running and whether
//they could use any help from her…

// 7113
//“Miss Granger,” said Professor McGonagall, “let me start by saying that I
//already know about the Headmaster asking you to make that wish -”

// 7114
//“He __told__ you?” blurted Hermione in startlement. The Headmaster had
//said no one else was supposed to know!

// 7115
//Professor McGonagall paused, looked at Hermione, and gave a sad little chuckle.
//“It’s good to see Mr. Potter hasn’t corrupted you too much. Miss Granger, you
//aren’t supposed to __admit__ anything just because I say I know. As it
//happens, the Headmaster did __not__ tell me, I simply know him too well.”

// 7116
//Hermione was blushing furiously now.

// 7117
//“It’s fine, Miss Granger!” said Professor McGonagall hastily. “You’re a
//Ravenclaw in your first year, nobody expects you to be a Slytherin.”

// 7118
//That __really__ stung.

// 7119
//“Fine,” said Hermione with some acerbity, “I’ll go ask Harry Potter for
//Slytherin lessons, then.”

// 7120
//“That __wasn’t__ what I wanted to…” said Professor McGonagall, and her
//voice trailed off. “Miss Granger, I’m worried about this __because__ young
//Ravenclaw girls shouldn’t have to be Slytherins! If the Headmaster asks you to
//get involved in something you’re not comfortable with, Miss Granger, it really
//is all right to say no. And if you’re feeling pressured, please tell the
//Headmaster that you would like me to be there, or that you would like to ask me
//first.”

// 7121
//Hermione’s eyes were very wide. “Does the Headmaster do things that are wrong?”

// 7122
//Professor McGonagall looked a little sad at that. “Not on purpose, Miss
//Granger, but I think… well, it probably __is__ true that sometimes the
//Headmaster has trouble remembering what it’s like to be a child. Even when he
//was a child, I’m sure he must have been brilliant, and strong of mind and
//heart, with courage enough for three Gryffindors. Sometimes the Headmaster asks
//too much of his young students, Miss Granger, or isn’t careful enough not to
//hurt them. He is a good man, but sometimes his plotting can go too far.”

// 7123
//“But it’s __good__ for students to be strong and have courage,” said
//Hermione. “That’s why you suggested Gryffindor for me, wasn’t it?”

// 7124
//Professor McGonagall smiled wryly. “Perhaps I was only being selfish, wanting
//you for my own House. Did the Sorting Hat offer you - no, I should not have
//asked.”

// 7125
//“It told me I might go anywhere but Slytherin,” said Hermione. She’d
//__almost__ asked why she wasn’t good enough for Slytherin, before she’d
//managed to stop herself… “So I __have__ courage, Professor!”

// 7126
//Professor McGonagall leaned forward over her desk. The worry was showing
//plainer on her face now. “Miss Granger, it’s not about courage, it’s about
//what’s healthy for young girls! The Headmaster is drawing you into his plots,
//Harry Potter is giving you his secrets to keep, and now you’re making alliances
//with Draco Malfoy! And I promised your mother that you would be safe at
//Hogwarts!”

// 7127
//Hermione just didn’t know what to say to that. But the thought was occurring to
//her that Professor McGonagall might not have been warning her if she’d been a
//boy in Gryffindor instead of a girl in Ravenclaw and __that__ was, well…
//“I’ll try to be good,” she said, “and I won’t let anyone tell me otherwise.”

// 7128
//Professor McGonagall pressed her hands over her eyes. When she took them away,
//her lined face looked very old. “Yes,” she said in a whisper, “you would have
//done well in my House. Stay safe, Miss Granger, and be careful. And if you are
//ever worried or uncomfortable about anything, please come to me at once. I
//won’t keep you any longer.”

// 7129
//__Aftermath, Draco Malfoy:__

// 7130
//Neither of them really wanted to do anything complicated that Saturday, not
//after fighting a battle earlier. So Draco was just sitting in an unused
//classroom and trying to read a book called __Thinking Physics.__ It was
//one of the most fascinating things that Draco had ever read in his life, at
//least the parts he could understand, at least when the __accursed idiot__
//who refused to let his books out of his sight could manage to __shut up__
//and let Draco __concentrate__ -

// 7131
//“Hermione Granger is a __muuudbloood,__” sang Harry Potter from where he
//sat at a nearby desk, reading a far more advanced book of his own.

// 7132
//“I know what you’re trying to do,” said Draco calmly without looking up from
//the pages. “It’s not going to work. We’re still ganging up and crushing you.”

// 7133
//“A __Maaaalfoy__ is working with a __muuudbloood,__ what will all
//your father’s __frieeeends__ think -”

// 7134
//“They’ll think Malfoys aren’t as easily manipulated as __you__ seem to
//believe, __Potter!__”

// 7135
//The Defense Professor was crazier than Dumbledore, no future saviour of the
//world could ever be this __childish__ and __undignified__ at any age.

// 7136
//“Hey, Draco, you know what’s really going to suck? __You__ know that
//Hermione Granger has two copies of the magical allele, just like you and just
//like me, but all your classmates in Slytherin don’t know that and
//__yooouuu’re__ not allowed to __explaaaaain__ -”

// 7137
//Draco’s fingers were whitening where they gripped the book. Being beaten and
//spat upon couldn’t possibly require this much self-control, and if he didn’t
//get back at Harry soon, he was going to do something incriminating -

// 7138
//“So what __did__ you wish the first time?” said Draco.

// 7139
//Harry didn’t say anything, so Draco looked up from his book, and felt a twinge
//of malicious satisfaction at the sad look on Harry’s face.

// 7140
//“Um,” Harry said. “A lot of people asked me that, but I don’t think Professor
//Quirrell would have wanted me to talk about it.”

// 7141
//Draco put a serious look on his own face. “You can talk about it with
//__me__. It’s probably not important compared to the other secrets you’ve
