//__May 13th, 1992.__

// 17310
//Argus Filch’s face appeared twisted in the light of the oil lamp he held,
//shadows dancing over his face. Behind them the doors of Hogwarts quickly
//receded, and the dark grounds moved closer. The track they now walked was muddy
//and indistinct.

// 17311
//The trees, branches formerly bare with winter, were not yet fully clad with
//spring; their branches stretched up toward the sky like lean fingers, skeletons
//visible amid the thin foliage. The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across
//it often threw them into darkness, lit only by the dim flames of Filch’s lamp.

// 17312
//Draco kept a firm grip on his wand.

// 17313
//“Where are you taking us?” said Tracey Davis. She’d been caught along with
//Draco by Filch, on their way to an attempted meeting of the Silvery Slytherins
//after curfew hours, and likewise given a detention.

// 17314
//“You just follow me,” said Argus Filch.

// 17315
//Draco was feeling rather annoyed with the whole affair. The Silvery Slytherins
//ought to be recognized school business. There was no reason why a secret
//conspiracy shouldn’t have permission to meet after curfew, if it was for the
//greater good of Hogwarts. If this happened one more time he’d talk to Daphne
//Greengrass and Daphne would talk to her father and then Filch would learn the
//wisdom of looking the other way where Malfoys were concerned.

// 17316
//The lights of the Hogwarts castle had diminished in the distance when Filch
//spoke again. “I bet you’ll think twice about breaking a school rule again,
//won’t you, eh?” Filch turned his head, away from the lamp, so that he could
//leer at the four students following him. “Oh yes… hard work and pain are the
//best teachers if you ask me… It’s just a pity they let the old punishments die
//out… hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I’ve got the
//chains still in my office, keep ‘em well oiled in case they’re ever needed…”

// 17317
//“Hey!” Tracey said, a touch of indignation entering her voice. “I’m too young
//to hear about that - that sort of - you know! Especially if the chains are
//well-oiled!”

// 17318
//Draco wasn’t paying attention. Filch simply wasn’t in Amycus Carrow’s league.

// 17319
//Behind them, one of the two older Slytherins following them snickered, though
//she didn’t say anything. Beside her was the other, a tall boy with an Slavic
//cast to his face, and who still spoke with an accent. They’d been caught for
//some unrelated offense, having to do with the type of thing Tracey went on
//about, and looked to be in their third or fourth year. “Pfeh,” said the taller
//boy. “In Durmstrang they hang you upside-down by your toes. By one toe, if you
//are insolent. Hogwarts was soft even in the old days.”

// 17320
//Argus Filch was silent for around half a minute, as though trying to think of a
//proper rejoinder, and then gave a chuckle. “We’ll see what you say about that…
//when you learn what you’ll be doing tonight! Ha!”

// 17321
//“I __said,__ I’m too young for that sort of thing!” said Tracey Davis. “It
//has to wait until I’m older!”

// 17322
//Ahead of them was a cottage with lighted windows, though the proportions seemed
//wrong.

// 17323
//Filch whistled, a high sharp sound, and a dog began barking.

// 17324
//From the cottage stepped forth a figure, making the trees seem too short around
//it. The figure was followed by a dog that seemed like a puppy by comparison,
//until you looked at it apart from the taller silhouette and realized the dog
//was huge, more like a wolf.

// 17325
//Draco’s eyes narrowed, before he caught himself. As a Silvery Slytherin he
//wasn’t supposed to be Prejudiced against any sentient being, especially not
//where other people might see him.

// 17326
//“What’s this?” said the figure, in the loud gruff voice of the half-giant. His
//umbrella lit up with a white glow, brighter than Filch’s dim lamp. In his other
//hand he held a crossbow; a quiver of short bolts was strapped to his upper arm.

// 17327
//“Students serving detention,” Filch said, loudly. “They’re to help you search
//the Forest for… whatever’s been eating ‘em.”

// 17328
//“The __Forest?__” gasped Tracey. “We can’t go in there at night!”

// 17329
//“That’s right,” said Filch, turning from Hagrid to glare at them. “It’s into
//the Forest you’re going, and I’m much mistaken if you’ll all come out in one
//piece.”

// 17330
//“But -” said Tracey. “There’s werewolves, I’ve heard, __and__ vampires,
//and everyone knows what happens when there’s a girl and a werewolf and a
//vampire all at the same time!”

// 17331
//The huge half-giant was frowning. “Argus, I ‘ad in mind you an’ maybe a few
//seventh-years. ‘Ere’s not much point in bringing along help if I’m to watch
//over ‘em the whole time.”

// 17332
//Argus’s face lit with cruel satisfaction. “That’s their lookout, isn’t it?
//Should’ve thought of them werewolves before they got in trouble, shouldn’t
//they? Send them out alone. I shouldn’t be too friendly to them, Hagrid. They’re
//here to be punished, after all.”

// 17333
//The half-giant gave a massive sigh (it sounded like a normal man having all the
//air driven out of his lungs by a Bludgeoning Hex). “Yeh’ve done yer bit. I’ll
//take over from here.”

// 17334
//“I’ll be back at dawn,” said Filch, “for what’s left of them,” he added
//nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing
//away in the darkness.

// 17335
//“Right then,” said Hagrid, “now, listen carefully, ‘cause it’s dangerous what
//we’re gonna do tonight an’ I don’ want no one takin’ risks. Follow me over here
//a moment.”

// 17336
//He led them to the very edge of the Forest. Holding his lamp up high he pointed
//down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees.
//A light breeze blew over Draco’s head as he looked into the Forest.

// 17337
//“There’s summat in there that’s bin eatin’ unicorns,” the huge man said.

// 17338
//Draco nodded; he distantly remembered hearing something along those lines a
//couple of weeks ago, toward the end of April.

// 17339
//“Did you call us to track down a trail of silvery blood to a wounded unicorn?”
//Tracey said excitedly.

// 17340
//“No,” said Draco, though he managed to stop the reflexive sneer. “Filch gave us
//the detention note at lunch today, at noon. Mr. Hagrid wouldn’t wait that long
//to find a wounded unicorn, and if we were looking for something like that, we’d
//look in the day when it’s bright. So,” Draco held up a finger, like he’d seen
//Inspector León do in plays, “I infer that we’re looking for something that only
//comes out at night.”

// 17341
//“Aye,” said the half-giant, sounding thoughtful. “Yer not what I expected,
//Draco Malfoy. Not what I expected at all. An’ you’d be Tracey Davis, then. I’ve
//heard of yeh. One of poor Miss Granger’s lot.” Rubeus Hagrid looked over at the
//two older Slytherins, peering at them in the light of his glowing umbrella.
//“An’ who’d yeh be, again? Don’t remember seeing much of yeh, boy.”

// 17342
//“Cornelia Walt,” said the witch, “and this is Yuri Yuliy,” indicating the
//Slavic-looking boy who’d spoken of Durmstrang. “His family is visiting from the
//Ukrainian lands, so he’s in Hogwarts just for the year.” The older boy nodded,
//a faintly contemptuous cast on his face.

// 17343
//“This is Fang,” Hagrid said, indicating the dog.

// 17344
//The five of them set off into the woods.

// 17345
//“What could be killing unicorns?” Draco said after they’d walked for a few
//minutes. Draco knew a bit about Dark creatures, but he couldn’t remember
//anything that was said to prey on unicorns. “What sort of creature does that,
//does anyone know?”

// 17346
//“Werewolves!” said Tracey.

// 17347
//“Miss Davis?” Draco said, and when she looked at him, he silently pointed a
//finger up at the moon. It was waxing gibbous, but not yet full.

// 17348
//“Oh, right,” said Tracey.

// 17349
//“No weres in the Forest,” said Hagrid. “They’re plain wizards most o’ the time,
//‘member. Couldn’t be wolves either, they’re not near fast enough ter catch a
//unicorn. Powerful magical creatures, unicorns are, I never knew one ter be hurt
//before.”

// 17350
//Draco listened to this, thinking about the puzzle almost despite himself. “Then
//what __is__ fast enough to catch a unicorn?”

// 17351
//“Wouldn’t ‘ave been a matter of speed,” Hagrid said, giving Draco an
//indecipherable glance. “Ere’s no end ter the ways that creatures hunt. Poison,
//darkness, traps. Imps as can’t be seen or heard or remembered, even while
//they’re eatin’ yer face. Always summat new an’ wonderful to learn.”

// 17352
//A cloud passed over the moon, casting the forest into shadow lit only by the
//glow of Hagrid’s umbrella.

// 17353
//“Meself,” Hagrid continued, “I think we might ‘ave a Parisian hydra on our
//‘ands. They’re no threat to a wizard, yeh’ve just got to keep holdin’ ‘em off
//long enough, and there’s no way yeh can lose. I mean literally no way yeh can
//lose so long’s yeh keep fightin’. Trouble is, against a Parisian hydra, most
//creatures give up long before. Takes a while to cut down all the heads, yeh
//see.”

// 17354
//“Bah,” said the foreign boy. “In Durmstrang we learn to fight Buchholz hydra.
//Unimaginably more tedious to fight! I mean literally, cannot imagine.
//First-years not believe us when we tell them winning is possible! Instructor
//must give second order, iterate until they comprehend.”

// 17355
//They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the Forest, until
//the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick.

// 17356
//Then Draco saw it, thick splashes on the roots of trees, gleaming a brighter
//color beneath the moonlight. “Is that -”

// 17357
//“Unicorn’s blood,” Hagrid said. The huge man’s voice was sad.

// 17358
//In a clearing ahead, visible through the tangled branches of a great oak, they
//saw the fallen creature, splayed beautiful and sad upon the ground, the dirt
//around her shining moon-silver with pooled blood. The unicorn was not white,
//but pale blue, or appearing so beneath the moon and night sky. Her slender legs
//stuck out at odd angles, obviously broken, and her mane spread across the dark
//leaves, green-black but with a sheen like pearls. On her flank was a small
//white shape like a starburst, a center surrounded by eight straight rays. Half
//her side had been ripped away, the edges ragged like the marks of teeth, bones
//and inner organs exposed.

// 17359
//A strange choking sensation rose in Draco’s throat.

// 17360
//“That’s ‘er,” Hagrid said, his sad whisper as loud as a normal man’s voice.
//“Just where I found ‘er this mornin’, dead as a dead doorknob. She is - was -
//the first unicorn I e’er met in these woods. I called ‘er Alicorn, not that it
//matters ter ‘er any more, I s’pose.”

// 17361
//“You named a unicorn Alicorn,” said the older girl. Her voice was a bit dry.

// 17362
//“But she doesn’t have wings,” Tracey said.

// 17363
//“An alicorn’s a unicorn’s horn,” Hagrid said, now louder. “Don’t know where yeh
//all started thinking it meant a unicorn with wings, ‘ere’s no such thing I ever
//heard. It’s just like naming a dog Fang,” indicating the huge wolf-like dog
//that barely came to his knees. “What’d you have called ‘er? Hannah, or some
//such? I gave ‘er a name as would’ve meant summat ter __‘er.__ Common
//courtesy, I call it.”

// 17364
//Nobody said anything to this, and after a further moment, the huge man gave a
//sharp nod. “We’ll start our search from ‘ere, the last place it struck. We’re
//gonna split inter two parties an’ follow the trail in diff’rent directions. Yeh
//two, Walt and Yuliy - yeh’ll go that way, and take Fang. There’s nothin’ that
//lives in the Forest that’ll hurt yeh if yer with Fang. Send up green sparks if
//yeh find summat interestin’, an’ send up red sparks if anyone gets in trouble.
//Davis, Malfoy, with me.”

// 17365
//The Forest was black and silent. Rubeus Hagrid had dimmed the light of his
//umbrella after they’d set out, so that Draco and Tracey had to steer themselves
//by the light of the moon, not without occasional trips and falls. They walked
//past a mossy tree-stump, the sound of running water speaking of a stream
//somewhere close by. Now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above
//lit a spot of silver blue blood on the fallen leaves; they were following the
//trail of blood, toward where the creature must have first struck the unicorn.

// 17366
//“There’s rumors about yeh,” Hagrid said in a low voice after they’d walked for
//a while.

// 17367
//“Well, they’re all true,” Tracey said. __“All__ of them.”

// 17368
//“Not yeh,” Hagrid said. “Did yeh really testify under Veritaserum that yeh
//tried to help Miss Granger, three times it was?”

// 17369
//Draco weighed his words for a while, and finally said, “Yes.” It wouldn’t have
//done to appear too eager to claim credit.

// 17370
//The huge man shook his head, his great feet still stomping silently through the
//woods. “I’m surprised, teh be honest. And yeh too, Davis, tryin’ to put the
//halls in order. Are yeh sure the Sorting Hat put yeh in the right place?
//There’s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin, so
//it’s always been said.”

// 17371
//“That’s not true,” Tracey said. “What about Xiaonan Tong the Black Raven,
//Spencer of the Hill, and Mister Kayvon?”

// 17372
//“Who?” said Hagrid.

// 17373
//“Just some of the best Dark Wizards from the last two centuries,” Tracey said.
//“They’re probably __the__ best from Hogwarts who weren’t from Slytherin.”
//Her voice fell, lost its enthusiasm. “Miss Granger always told me I should read
//up on anything I -”

// 17374
//__“Anyway,” __Draco said quickly, “that’s not really relevant, Mr. Hagrid.
//Even if -” Draco worked it around in his head, trying to translate the
//difference between __probability of Slytherin given Dark __and
//__probability of Dark given Slytherin__ into nonscientific language. “Even
//if most Dark Wizards are from Slytherin, very few Slytherins are Dark Wizards.
//There aren’t all that many Dark Wizards, so not all Slytherins can be one.” Or
//as Father had said, while any Malfoy should certainly know much of the secret
//lore, the more… __costly__ rituals were better left to useful fools like
//Amycus Carrow.

// 17375
//“So yeh’re saying,” Hagrid said, “that most Dark Wizards are Slytherins… but…”

// 17376
//“But most Slytherins are not Dark Wizards,” Draco said. He had a weary feeling
//they’d be at this a while, but like fighting a hydra, the important thing was
//to not give up.

// 17377
//“I never thought of it that way,” the huge man said, sounding awestruck. “But,
//well, if yeh’re not all a house of snakes, then why - __get behind that
//tree!__”

// 17378
//Hagrid seized Draco and Tracey and hoisted them off the path behind a towering
//oak. He pulled out a bolt and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready to
//fire. The three of them listened. Something was slithering over dead leaves
//nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squinting
//up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away.

// 17379
//“I knew it,” Hagrid murmured. “There’s summat in here that shouldn’ be.”

// 17380
//They went after where the rustling sound had come from, with Hagrid in the lead
//and Tracey and Draco both gripping their wands at the ready, but they found
//nothing, despite searching in a widening circle with their ears straining for
//the faintest sound.

// 17381
//They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Draco kept looking over his
//shoulder, a feeling nagging at him that they were being watched. They had just
//passed a bend in the path when Tracey yelled and pointed.

// 17382
//In the distance, a shower of red sparks lit the air.

// 17383
//“You two wait here!” Hagrid shouted. “Stay where yeh are, I’ll come back for
//yeh!”

// 17384
//Before Draco could say a word, Hagrid spun and crashed away through the
//undergrowth.

// 17385
//Draco and Tracey stood looking at each other, until they heard nothing but the
//rustling of leaves around them. Tracey looked scared, but trying to hide it.
//Draco was feeling more annoyed than anything else. Apparently Rubeus Hagrid,
//when he had formed his plans for tonight, had not spent even five seconds
//visualizing the consequences if something actually went wrong.

// 17386
//“Now what?” said Tracey, her voice a little high.

// 17387
//“We wait for Mr. Hagrid to come back.”

// 17388
//The minutes dragged by. Draco’s ears seemed sharper than usual, picking up
//every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. Tracey kept looking up at the
//moon, as though to reassure herself that it wasn’t full yet.

// 17389
//“I’m -” Tracey whispered. “I’m getting a little nervous, Mr. Malfoy.”

// 17390
//Draco thought about it a bit. To be honest, there __was__ something… well,
//it wasn’t that he was a coward, or even that he was scared. But there had been
//a murder at Hogwarts and if he’d been watching himself in a play, having just
//been abandoned in the Forbidden Forest by a half-giant, he would currently feel
//like yelling at the boy on stage that he should…

// 17391
//Draco reached into his robes, and took out a mirror. Tapping the surface showed
//a man in red robes, who frowned almost immediately.

// 17392
//“Auror Captain Eneasz Brodski,” the man said clearly, causing Tracey to start
//with the loudness in the quiet forest. “What is it, Draco Malfoy?”

// 17393
//“Put me on ten-minute check-in,” Draco said. He’d decided not to complain
//directly about his detention. He did __not__ want to look like a spoiled
//brat. “If I don’t respond, come get me. I’m in the Forbidden Forest.”

// 17394
//Inside the mirror, the Auror’s brows rose. “What are you doing in the Forbidden
//Forest, Mr. Malfoy?”

// 17395
//“Looking for the unicorn-eater with Mr. Hagrid,” Draco said, and tapped the
//mirror off, putting it back in his robes before the Auror could ask anything
//about detentions or say anything about serving it out without complaining.

// 17396
//Tracey’s head turned toward him, though it was a little too dim to read her
//expression. “Um, thanks,” she whispered.

// 17397
//The few leaves which had emerged on their branches rustled as another, colder
//breeze blew through the forest.

// 17398
//Tracey’s voice was a little louder when she spoke again. “You didn’t have to -”
//she said, now sounding a little shy.

// 17399
//“Don’t mention it, Miss Davis.”

// 17400
//The dark silhouette of Tracey put her hand to her cheek, as though to conceal a
//blush that wasn’t visible anyway. “I mean, not for __me__ -”

// 17401
//“No, really,” Draco said. “Don’t mention it. At all.” He would have threatened
//to take out the mirror and order Captain Brodski not to rescue __her,__
//but he was afraid she would consider that flirting.

// 17402
//Tracey’s silhouetted head turned from him, looked away. Finally she said, in a
//smaller voice, “It’s too soon, isn’t it -”

// 17403
//A high scream echoed through the woods, a not-quite-human sound, the scream of
//something like a horse; and Tracey shrieked and ran.

// 17404
//__“No, you numbskull!__” yelled Draco, plunging after her. The sound had
//been so eerie that Draco wasn’t certain where it came from - but he thought
//that Tracey Davis might, in fact, be running straight toward the source of that
//eerie scream.

// 17405
//Brambles whipped at Draco’s eyes, he had to keep one hand in front of his face
//to shield them, trying not to lose track of Tracey because it seemed obvious
//that, if this was a play, and they got separated, __one__ of them was
//going to die. Draco thought of the mirror secured within his robes but he
//somehow knew that if he tried to take it out one-handed while running, the
//mirror would inevitably fall and be lost -

// 17406
//Ahead of them, Tracey had stopped, and Draco felt relieved for an instant,
//before he saw.

// 17407
//Another unicorn lay on the ground, surrounded by a slowly widening pool of
//silver blood, the edge of the blood creeping across the ground like spilled
//mercury. Her coat was purple, like the color of the night sky, her horn exactly
//the same twilight color as her skin, her visible flank marked by a pink
//star-blotch surrounded by white patches. The sight tore at Draco’s heart, even
//more than the other unicorn because this one’s eyes were staring glassily right
//at him, and because there was a -

// 17408
//- blurring, twisting form -

// 17409
//- feeding on an open wound on the unicorn’s side, like it was drinking from it
  //-

// 17410
//- Draco couldn’t understand, somehow couldn’t recognize what he was seeing -

// 17411
//- __it was looking at them.__

// 17412
//The blurring, seething, unrecognizable darkness seemed to turn to regard them.
//A hiss came from it, like the hiss of the deadliest snake which ever had
//existed, something more dangerous by far than any Blue Krait.

// 17413
//Then it bent back over the wound in the unicorn, and continued to drink.

// 17414
//The mirror was in Draco’s hand, and it remained lifeless as his finger
//mechanically tapped at the surface, over and over.

// 17415
//Tracey was holding her wand now, saying things like “Prismatis” and “Stupefy”
//but nothing was happening.

// 17416
//Then the seething outline rose up, like a man rising to his feet only not so;
//and it seemed to scuttle forward, moving with a strange half-jump across the
//dying unicorn’s legs, approaching the two of them.

// 17417
//Tracey tugged at his sleeve and then turned to run, run from something that
//could hunt down unicorns. Before she could take three steps there came another
//terrible hiss, burning his ears, and Tracey fell to the ground and did not
//move.

// 17418
//Somewhere in the back of his mind, Draco knew that he was about to die. Even if
//the Auror checked his mirror this very instant, there was no way anyone could
//get here fast enough. There was no __time.__

// 17419
//Running hadn’t worked.

// 17420
//Magic hadn’t worked.

// 17421
//The seething outline came closer, while Draco tried, in his last moments, to
//solve the riddle.

// 17422
//Then a blazing silver ball of light plunged out of the night sky and hung
//there, illuminating the forest as bright as daylight, and the seething outline
//leapt backwards, as though in horror of the light.

// 17423
//Four broomsticks plunged out of the sky, three Aurors with bright multicolored
//shields and Harry Potter holding his wand aloft, seated behind Professor
//McGonagall within a larger shield.

// 17424
//“Get out of here!” roared Professor McGonagall -

// 17425
//__- an instant before the seething thing gave forth another terrible
//hiss, and all the shielding spells winked out. The three Aurors and Professor
//McGonagall fell off their broomsticks and dropped heavily to the forest floor,
//lying motionless.__

// 17426
//__Draco couldn’t breathe, the most intense fear he’d ever felt in his
//life gripping all through his chest, sending tendrils around his heart.__

// 17427
//__Harry Potter, who had remained untouched, silently guided his
//broomstick toward the ground -__

// 17428
//__- and then leapt off to stand between Draco and the seething outline,
//interposing himself like a living shield.__

// 17429
//__“Run!” said Harry Potter, turning his head half-back to look at Draco.
//The silver moonlight gleamed on his face. “Run, Draco! I’ll hold it off!”__

// 17430
//__“You can’t fight that thing alone!” Draco cried aloud. A nausea was in
//his stomach, a churning sensation that, looking back in memory, seemed both
//like and unlike a sense of guilt, as though it had the sensations but not quite
//all of the emotion.__

// 17431
//__“I must,” Harry Potter said grimly. “Go!”__

// 17432
//__“Harry, I - I’m sorry, for everything - I” Though later, looking back,
//Draco couldn’t quite remember what he’d meant to apologize for, maybe it’d been
//that he was planning to overthow Harry’s conspiracy, all that time ago.__

// 17433
//__The seething figure, now seeming blacker and more terrible, rose up
//into the air, hovering off the ground.__

// 17434
//__“GO!” shouted Harry.__

// 17435
//__Draco turned and fled headlong into the woods,with the branches
//whipping at his face. Behind him, Draco heard another terrible hiss, and
//Harry’s voice rising, crying something that Draco couldn’t make out from the
//distance; Draco turned his head for only an instant to look back, and in that
//moment ran into something, hitting his head HARD, and blacked out.__

***

// 17436
//Harry held a tight grip on his wand, a Prismatic Sphere glowing around him. He
//stared levelly at the seething, blurring form in front of him, and said, “What
//on Earth are you doing?”

// 17437
//The seething blurs resolved, reformed, relaxed back into a hooded form.
//Whatever concealment had been at work - a device rather than a Charm, Harry
//guessed, since the magic had been able to affect him - had prevented his mind
//from recognizing the shape or even that the shape was human. But it hadn’t
//prevented Harry from recognizing the sharp sense of doom.

// 17438
//Professor Quirrell stood straight with silver blood all down the front of his
//enshrouding black cloak, and gave a sigh, looking at the fallen forms of three
//Aurors, Tracey Davis, Draco Malfoy, and Professor McGonagall. “I had honestly
//thought,” Professor Quirrell murmured, “that I jammed that mirror without
//alarm. What were two first-year Slytherins doing alone in the Forbidden Forest?
//Mr. Malfoy has more sense than this… What a fiasco.”

// 17439
//Harry didn’t answer. The sense of doom was as strong as Harry could ever
//remember feeling it, a feeling of power in the air so great that it was almost
//tangible. Some part of him was still viscerally shocked at how fast the shields
//surrounding the Aurors had been torn apart. He almost hadn’t been able to
//__see__ the successive lashes of color which had torn away the shields
//like tissue paper. It made the duel Professor Quirrell had fought against the
//Auror in Azkaban look like a mockery, a child’s game - though Professor
//Quirrell had claimed, then, that if he’d fought for real the Auror would have
//been dead in seconds; and Harry knew now that this was also true.

// 17440
//Just how high did the power ladder go?

// 17441
//“I take it,” Harry said, managing to keep his voice steady, “that your eating
//unicorns has something to do with why you’ll get fired from the Defense
//Professor position. I don’t suppose you’d care to explain in considerable
//detail?”

// 17442
//Professor Quirrell looked at him. The almost tangible sense of power in the air
//seemed to diminish, drawing back into the Defense Professor. “I shall indeed
//explain myself,” the Defense Professor said. “I need to cast a few Memory
//Charms first, and then we may go off and discuss it, for it would not be wise
//for me to stay. You will return to this time later, as I know.”

// 17443
//Harry willed himself to be able to see through the Cloak he had mastered; and
//knew that another Harry stood beside him, hidden by his own Deathly Hallow.
//Harry then told his Cloak to hide himself from himself once more, and it did;
//being able to perceive your future self meant having to match the memory later.

// 17444
//Harry’s own voice said, then, sounding strange in present-Harry’s ears, “He has
//a surprisingly good explanation.”

// 17445
//Present-Harry remembered the words as best he could. Nothing more was said
//between them.

// 17446
//Professor Quirrell walked to Draco’s form, and chanted the spell of the False
//Memory Charm. The Defense Professor stood there for perhaps a minute, seemingly
//lost to the world.

// 17447
//Harry had been studying Obliviations, these last couple of weeks - though he
//couldn’t have helped cast the spells, unless he was willing to exhaust himself
//almost completely, and for some reason they wanted an Auror to lose every
//single life memory involving the color blue. But Harry had some idea, now, of
//the concentration which the far more difficult False Memory Charm entailed. You
//had to try to live the other person’s entire life inside your own head, at
//least if you wanted to create the False Memories with less than a
//sixteen-to-one slowdown as you separately crafted sixteen major tracks of
//memory. It might have been quiet, there might have been no outward sign; but
//Harry knew something of the difficulties now, and he knew to be impressed.

// 17448
//Professor Quirrell finished, and moved on to Tracey Davis, then the three
//Aurors, and finally Professor McGonagall. Harry waited, but future-Harry made
//no protest. It was possible that even Professor McGonagall, if she’d been
//awake, wouldn’t have protested. It was not yet the Ides of May, and apparently
//there would be a surprisingly good explanation.

// 17449
//With a gesture, Draco’s stunned body was lifted, and sent a short distance into
//the woods, before being carefully deposited on the ground. Then a final gesture
//from Professor Quirrell ripped a huge chunk out of the unicorn’s side, leaving
//behind ragged edges; the raw meat hovered in the air, then wavered in
//Vanishment and was gone.

// 17450
//“Done,” Professor Quirrell said. “I must depart this place now, Mr. Potter.
//Come with me, and remain here.”

// 17451
//Professor Quirrell strode away, and Harry followed and remained behind.

// 17452
//They walked through the woods in silence for a time, before Harry heard faint
//voices in the distance. The next set of Aurors, presumably, after the first set
//had fallen out of contact. What his future self was saying, Harry didn’t know.

// 17453
//“They won’t detect us, nor hear our speech,” said Professor Quirrell. The sense
//of power and doom around the Defense Professor was still strong. The man seated
//himself on a tree stump, one where the light of the almost-full moon fell full
//on him. “I should first say that when you speak to the Aurors, in the future,
//you should tell them that you frightened away the seething dark, the same as
//you did that Dementor. It is what Mr. Malfoy will remember seeing.” Professor
//Quirrell gave a small sigh. “It may cause some alarm, if they conclude that
//some horror kin to Dementors, and strong enough to break the Aurors’ shields,
//is loose in the Forbidden Forest. But I could not think of what else to do. If
//the forest is better-guarded after this - but with any luck I have already
//consumed what I need. Would you mind telling me how you arrived so quickly? How
//did you know Mr. Malfoy was in trouble?”

// 17454
//After Captain Brodski had learned that Draco Malfoy was in the Forbidden
//Forest, seemingly in the company of Rubeus Hagrid, Brodski had begun inquiring
//to find out who had authorized this, and had still been unable to find out when
//Draco Malfoy had missed check-in. Despite Harry’s protests, the Auror Captain,
//who was authorized to know about Time-Turners, had refused to allow deployment
//to before the time of the missed check-in; there were standard procedures
//involving Time. But Brodski had given Harry written orders allowing him to go
//back and deploy an Auror trio to arrive one second after the missed check-in
//time. There had been a Patronus Charm to locate Draco, which Harry had
//successfully willed to take the form of a ball of pure silver light, and the
//flight of Aurors had arrived on time to the second.

// 17455
//“I’m afraid I couldn’t say,” Harry replied evenly. Professor Quirrell was still
//a major suspect, and it was good for him not to know the details. “Now why are
//you eating unicorns?”

// 17456
//“Ah,” Professor Quirrell said. “As to that…” The man hesitated. “I was drinking
//the blood of unicorns, not eating them. The missing flesh, the ragged marks
//upon the body - those were to obscure the case, to make it seem like some other
//predator. The use of unicorn’s blood is too well-known.”

// 17457
//“I don’t know it,” Harry said.

// 17458
//“I know you do not,” the Defense Professor said sharply. “Or you would not be
//pestering me about it. The power of unicorn’s blood is to preserve your life
//for a time, even if you are on the very verge of death.”

// 17459
//There was a stretch of time when Harry’s brain claimed to be refusing to
//process the words, which was of course a lie, because you couldn’t know the
//meaning you weren’t allowed to process, without having already processed it.

// 17460
//A strange sense of blankness overtook Harry, an absence of reaction, maybe this
//was what other people felt like when someone went off-script, and they couldn’t
//say or think of anything to do.

// 17461
//Of course Professor Quirrell was dying, not just occasionally ill.

// 17462
//Professor Quirrell had known he was dying. He’d volunteered to take the Defense
//Professor position at Hogwarts, after all.

// 17463
//Of course he’d been getting worse the whole school year. Of course illnesses
//which kept getting worse had a predictable destination at their end.

// 17464
//Harry’s brain had surely known already, somewhere in the safe back of his mind
//where he could refuse to process things he’d already processed.

// 17465
//Of course that was why Professor Quirrell wouldn’t be able to teach Battle
//Magic next year. Professor McGonagall wouldn’t even have to fire him. He would
//just be -

// 17466
//- dead.

// 17467
//“No,” Harry said, his voice a little shaky. “There has to be a way -”

// 17468
//“I am not stupid nor particularly eager to die. I have already looked. I had to
//go this far simply to last out my lesson plans, having less time than I had
//thought, and -” The head of the dark moonlit figure turned away. “I think I do
//not want to hear about it, Mr. Potter.”

// 17469
//Harry’s breath hitched. Too many emotions were bubbling up in him at once.
//After denial came anger, according to a ritual someone had just made up. And
//yet it seemed surprisingly appropriate.

// 17470
//“And why -” Harry’s breath hitched again. “Why isn’t unicorn’s blood standard
//in healer’s kits, then? To keep someone alive, even if they’re on the very
//verge of dying from their legs being eaten?”

// 17471
//“Because there are permanent side effects,” Professor Quirrell said quietly.

// 17472
//“Side effects? __Side effects?__ What kind of side effect is medically
//worse than __DEATH?__” Harry’s voice rose on the last word until he was
//shouting.

// 17473
//“Not everyone thinks the same way we do, Mr. Potter. Though, to be fair, the
//blood must come from a live unicorn and the unicorn must die in the drinking.
//Would I be here otherwise?”

// 17474
//Harry turned, stared at the surrounding trees. “Have a herd of unicorns at St.
//Mungos. Floo the patients there, or use portkeys.”

// 17475
//“Yes, that would work.”

// 17476
//Harry’s face tightened, the only outward sign behind his trembling hands of
//everything that was welling up inside him. He needed to scream, needed some
//outlet, needed __something__ he couldn’t name and finally Harry leveled
//his wand at a tree and shouted __“Diffindo!__”

// 17477
//There was a sharp tearing sound, and a cut appeared across the wood.

// 17478
//__“Diffindo!”__

// 17479
//Another cut. Harry had learned the Charm only ten days previously, after he’d
//started getting serious about self-defense. It was theoretically a second-year
//Charm, but the anger pouring through him seemed to know no bounds, he knew
//enough now not to exhaust himself and he still had power yet.

// 17480
//__“Diffindo!__” Harry had aimed at a branch this time, and it plummeted to
//the ground with a sound of twigs and leaves.

// 17481
//There didn’t seem to be any tears inside him, only pressure with no outlet.

// 17482
//“I shall leave you to it,” Professor Quirrell said quietly. The Defense
//Professor rose from his tree stump, the unicorn’s blood still moonlit on the
//black cloak he wore, and drew his hood back over his head.
