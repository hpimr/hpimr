//__June 4th, 1992.__

// 17689
//Daphne Greengrass was in the Slytherin common room, writing a letter to her
//Lady Mother (who was surprisingly intransigent about power-sharing, despite not
//even __being__ in Hogwarts to exercise control) when she saw Draco Malfoy
//stagger in through the portrait door carrying what must have been a dozen
//books, Vincent and Gregory behind him each carrying a dozen more. The Auror
//who’d accompanied Malfoy stuck his head in briefly, then withdrew to
//who-knew-where.

// 17690
//Draco looked around, then seemed to be struck by a bright idea as he staggered
//toward her, Vincent and Gregory following after.

// 17691
//“Can you help me read these?” said Draco, sounding slightly out of breath as he
//approached.

// 17692
//“What.” Lessons were over__,__ only the exams were left now, and since
//when did __Malfoys__ ask __Greengrasses__ for help with their
//homework?

// 17693
//“These,” Draco Malfoy said importantly, “are all the library books Miss Granger
//borrowed between April 1st and April 16th. I thought I’d go through them in
//case there are any Clues there, only then I thought, maybe __you__ should
//help because you knew Miss Granger better.”

// 17694
//Daphne stared at the books. “The General read all that in __two weeks?__”
//A twinge of pain went through her heart, but she suppressed it.

// 17695
//“Well, I don’t know if Miss Granger finished them all,” Draco said. He held up
//a cautioning finger. “In fact, we don’t know if she read any of them, or if she
//really borrowed them, I mean, all we’ve __observed__ is that the library
//ledger says she checked them out -”

// 17696
//Daphne suppressed a groan. Malfoy had been talking like this for weeks. There
//were some people who clearly were not meant to be involved with mysterious
//murders because it did __strange things to their minds__. “Mr. Malfoy, I
//couldn’t read all these if I spent my whole summer doing nothing else.”

// 17697
//“Then just skim through them, please?” Draco said. “Especially if there’s, you
//know, mysterious words scribbled in her handwriting, or a bookmark left inside,
//or -”

// 17698
//“I’ve seen those plays too, Mr. Malfoy.” Daphne rolled her eyes. “Don’t we have
//__Aurors__ now for -”

// 17699
//“__We’re doomed!__” shrieked Millicent Bulstrode, as she burst up from the
//lower chambers into the Slytherin common room.

// 17700
//People paused to look at her.

// 17701
//“__It’s Professor Quirrell!__”

// 17702
//A sudden air of attentiveness, as of long-standing disputes about to be
//settled. “Well, finally,” someone said, as Millicent tried to catch her breath.
//“He’s only got, what, ten days left to go bad?”

// 17703
//“Eleven days,” said the seventh-year who was running the betting pool.

// 17704
//“__He’s gotten a little better suddenly and he’s going to summon the
//first-years for our Defense final! By surprise! In fifty minutes!__”

// 17705
//“A Defense final?” Pansy said blankly. “But Professor Quirrell doesn’t give
//exams.”

// 17706
//“The __Ministry__ Defense final!” shrieked Millicent.

// 17707
//“But Professor Quirrell doesn’t teach anything from the Ministry curriculum,”
//objected Pansy.

// 17708
//Daphne was already fleeing to her room, racing for the first-year Defense
//textbook that she hadn’t touched since September and screaming curses inside
//her mind.

// 17709
//One desk back of her, someone was crying, their soft sobs providing a
//background chant of despair for the classroom. Daphne looked back, expecting to
//see a Hufflepuff and hoping it wasn’t Hannah, and was surprised at first
//(though not on further reflection) to see it was a Ravenclaw.

// 17710
//Before them were set the exam parchments, turned over, waiting for the bell.

// 17711
//Fifty minutes hadn’t been nearly enough preparation time, but it was something,
//and Daphne was now feeling ashamed that she hadn’t thought to send messengers
//to warn the Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Gryffindor Houses. They’d started giving
//House Points again just three days ago, at the beginning of June, but the
//Auxiliary Protective Special Committee still ought to promote House unity.

// 17712
//Another Ravenclaw, sitting four desks to her left, also started to cry. That
//was Katherine Tung of Dragon Army, if she recalled correctly, whom she’d once
//seen take on three Sunshine Soldiers simultaneously without a flinch.

// 17713
//Daphne had calmed down after the first couple of minutes of frantic reading. It
//was just a test, not a __murder__ or anything; and if almost all the
//first-year students turned in mostly blank parchments then it stood to reason
//that nobody would be shamed. But Daphne could understand, if not exactly
//sympathize, that Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs might not see it that way.

// 17714
//“He’s evil,” another Ravenclaw witch said in a shaking voice. “One hundred
//percent pure Dark Wizard to the bone. The Dark Lord Grindelwald wouldn’t do
//this, not to children, he’s worse than You-Know-Who.”

// 17715
//Daphne looked reflexively at where Professor Quirrell was sitting, slumped to
//one side but his eyes alert; and she thought she saw the Defense Professor
//smile for one tiny instant. No, that had to be her imagination, there was no
//way the Defense Professor could have heard that.

// 17716
//The bell rang.

// 17717
//Daphne flipped the parchment over.

// 17718
//The top was stamped with the seals for the Ministry, the Hogwarts Board of
//Governors, and the Department of Magical Education, and runes to detect
//cheating. Below that was a line for her to write her name, and a list of exam
//rules with a picture of Lindsay Gagnon, the Director of the Department of
//Magical Education, shaking an admonishing finger at everyone.

// 17719
//Halfway down the page was the first exam question.

// 17720
//It was, __Why is it important for children to stay away from strange
//creatures?__

// 17721
//There was a stunned pause.

// 17722
//One student began laughing, she thought it was from the Gryffindor section of
//the class. Professor Quirrell made no motion to censor it, and the laughter
//spread.

// 17723
//Nobody spoke aloud, but the students looked around at each other, exchanging
//glances as the laughter died down, and then as if by some unspoken agreement
//they all looked at Professor Quirrell, who was smiling down at them
//benevolently.

// 17724
//Daphne bent over her exam, wearing a defiant evil smile that would have done
//proud to either Godric Gryffindor or Grindelwald; and she wrote down,
//__Because my Stunning Hex, my Most Ancient Blade, and my Patronus Charm
//won’t work against everything.__

// 17725
//Harry Potter turned over the last page of his Defense exam.

// 17726
//Even Harry had needed to quash a small bit of nervousness, some tiny remnant of
//his childhood, upon reading the first real question (‘How can you make a
//Shrieking Eel be silent?’). Professor Quirrell’s lessons had spent roughly zero
//time on the surprising yet useless trivia that some idiot had imagined a
//‘Defense class’ should look like. In principle, Harry could have used his
//Time-Turner to read through the first-year Defense book after being notified of
//the surprise exam; but that might have unfairly skewed the grading curve for
//others. After staring at the question for a couple of seconds, Harry had
//written down ‘Quieting Charm’, and included the casting directions in case the
//Ministry grader didn’t believe that Harry knew it.

// 17727
//Once Harry had decided to just answer all the questions __correctly,__ the
//exam had gone by very quickly. The most realistic answer to more than half the
//questions was ‘Stunning Hex’, and many of the other questions had optimal
//solutions along the lines of ‘Turn around and walk in the opposite direction’
//or ‘Throw away the cheese and buy a new pair of shoes.’

// 17728
//The last question on the test was “What would you do if you suspected there
//might be a Bogeysnake underneath your bed?” The Ministry-approved answer, Harry
//could in fact recall from his read-through of the textbook at the start of the
//year, was __Tell your parents.__ The problem with this had occurred to
//Harry right away, which was why Harry had remembered it.

// 17729
//After some pondering, Harry wrote down:

// 17730
//__Dear Ministry grader: I’m afraid the real answer to that is a secret,
//but rest assured that a Bogeysnake would present no more trouble to me than a
//mountain troll, a Dementor, or You-Know-Who. Please inform your superiors that
//I find your standard answer prejudicial to Muggleborns, and that I expect this
//failing will be corrected at once without any need for my direct intervention.__

// 17731
//__Sincerely, the Boy-Who-Lived.__

// 17732
//Harry signed the last parchment with a broad flourish, turned it over into his
//stack, put down his quill, and sat up.

// 17733
//Looking around, Harry saw that Professor Quirrell seemed to be looking in his
//rough direction, though the Defense Professor’s head had nodded to one side.
//The other students were still writing. Some of them were silently crying, but
//they were still writing. __Continuing to fight__ was also a lesson
//Professor Quirrell had taught.

// 17734
//Interminably later, the official exam time was up. A seventh-year student went
//from desk to desk, collecting the exams in Professor Quirrell’s place.

// 17735
//The last exam parchment was collected, and Professor Quirrell sat up straight.

// 17736
//“My young students,” he said softly. The seventh-year student had her wand
//trained on the Defense Professor’s mouth, so that they all heard his voice
//seeming to come from right beside them. “I know… that probably seemed very
//fearsome to some of you… it is a different kind of fear from facing the enemy’s
//wand… you must conquer it separately. So I… shall tell you this now. It is the
//custom of Hogwarts… that grades are given in the second week of June. But for
//my case… they can make an exception, I think.” The Defense Professor smiled his
//familiar dry smile, tinged now as though by a suppressed grimace. “I know you
//are worried… that you were not prepared for this exam… that my lessons have not
//covered this material… and I quite forgot to mention… that it was approaching…
//though you should have known… it would come in time. But I have just now
//magically checked… the answers you have given on that… terribly, terribly
//important final exam… though of course only the Ministry grade is official… and
//assigned your full-year grades taking the results into account… and magically
//written your full grades down on these parchments,” Professor Quirrell tapped a
//stack of parchments on the side of his desk, “which will now be handed out… an
//incredible spell… is it not?”

// 17737
//A few students on the Ravenclaw side were looking indignant, but for the most
//part the students just looked relieved, and some Slytherins were chuckling.
//Harry would have laughed too, if not for the pain of watching Professor
//Quirrell gasp out the words.

// 17738
//The seventh-year student standing beside Professor Quirrell pointed her wand
//and spoke an incantation in magical pseudo-Latin. The parchments rose up and
//started to drift through the air, separating in mid-flow to drift toward each
//student.

// 17739
//Harry waited until his parchment had arrived on his desk, and then unfolded it.

// 17740
//The parchment said EE+, which stood for Exceeds Expectations. It was the
//second-highest grade letter, the highest being Outstanding.

// 17741
//In another world, a distant vanished world, a little boy named Harry would have
//shouted with indignation about receiving only the second-highest grade. This
//Harry sat quietly and thought. Professor Quirrell was making some point, and it
//wasn’t as though the exact grade letter mattered in any other way. Was
//Professor Quirrell saying that Harry had done relatively well, but not lived up
//to his full potential? Or was the grade meant to be read literally, that Harry
//had in fact exceeded the Defense Professor’s expectations?

// 17742
//“All of you… pass,” Professor Quirrell said, as the students all looked at
//their final grades, as sighs of relief rose from desks and Lavender Brown
//raised her parchment in a clenched fist held high with triumph. “Every student
//in first-year Battle Magic has passed… except for one.”

// 17743
//A number of students looked up in sudden terror.

// 17744
//Harry sat there silently. He had seen the point immediately, and even if it was
//a wrong point, he knew Professor Quirrell would never, ever be talked out of
//making it.

// 17745
//“All of you in this room… have received grades of at least Acceptable. Neville
//Longbottom… who took this test in the Longbottom home… received a grade of
//Outstanding. But the other student who is not here… has had a Dreadful grade
//entered on her record… for failing the only important test… that was given her
//this year. I would have marked her even lower… but that would have been in poor
//taste.”

// 17746
//The room was very quiet, though a number of students were staring angrily at
//the Professor.

// 17747
//“You may think that a grade of Dreadful… is not fair. That Miss Granger was
//faced with a test… for which her lessons… had not prepared her. That she was
//not told… that the exam was coming on that day.”

// 17748
//The Defense Professor drew in a shaking breath.

// 17749
//“Such is realism,” said Professor Quirrell. “The only important test… may come
//at any time… be better prepared for it… than she was. As for the rest of you…
//those who have received Exceeds Expectations or above… have received my letters
//of recommendation… to certain organizations beyond Britain’s shores… where your
//training might be completed. They will contact you… when you are old enough… if
//you still appear worthy… and if you have not failed an important test. And
//remember… from this day… you must train yourselves… you cannot rely… on future
//Defense professors. Your first year of Battle Magic is over… you are
//dismissed.”

// 17750
//Professor Quirrell sat back with his eyes closed, seeming to ignore the excited
//babble that broke out around him.

// 17751
//In time most of the students had departed, and one remained, staying a
//prescribed distance from the Defense Professor.

// 17752
//The Defense Professor opened his eyes.

// 17753
//Harry raised the parchment with its __EE+,__ still silent.

// 17754
//The Defense Professor smiled, and it went all the way to those tired eyes.

// 17755
//“It is the same grade… that I received in my own first year.”

// 17756
//“Th, th, th,” Harry couldn’t make the words __thank you__ come out, they
//were stuck in his suddenly closed throat, the Defense Professor tilting his
//head and giving him an inquiring stare, so Harry just bowed jerkily and then
//left the room.
