//== Self Actualization, Pt 4

// 12069
//It was out of the corner of her eye that Hermione Granger saw it, a reflection
//on the polished metal of a statue at the junction of two corridors, a flash of
//gold, a flash of red, something like an image of fire; just for a moment she
//saw it, and then it was gone.

// 12070
//She paused, puzzled, and she __almost__ walked away, but there had been
//something familiar about that brief glow -

// 12071
//Hermione walked forward to where the statue had stood, looked at the corridor
//from which she thought the fiery reflection might have come.

// 12072
//Faintly, as though from a faraway place, she heard the cry, the call.

// 12073
//Hermione started to run.

// 12074
//She ran for a while; whenever she got to a junction she would pause, catch as
//much breath as she could, and then she would see a flash of fire reflected from
//one direction or another, or hear that distant call. If it hadn’t been for her
//army training she would’ve fallen over in exhaustion, running like that.

// 12075
//She never saw the phoenix.

// 12076
//And then she came to a four-way branch and there was __nothing,__ no sign,
//she waited for long seconds and she heard no cry and saw no fire, and she was
//only just starting to wonder with a sick sad feeling if she’d imagined the
//whole thing, when she heard a __person__ cry out.

// 12077
//When her rapidly racing feet turned the corner her mind took in the whole scene
//at a glance, three huge boys in green-trimmed robes already turning to look at
//her, and one shorter and smaller boy in yellow, who was dangling in the air
//from one foot held up high by an invisible hand.

// 12078
//The Sunshine General didn’t even think about it, people who stopped to think
//didn’t spring very good ambushes.

// 12079
//Her wand was in her hand, her fingers did the twist and her lips said
//“__Somnium!__” and the largest bully fell over, the Hufflepuff boy dropped
//out of the air with a __thump__ and the other two bullies were trying to
//aim their wands at her and she said ”__Somnium!__” again and another huge
//boy keeled over - the one who’d been aiming his wand faster, that was who she’d
//fired at.

// 12080
//Unfortunately casting two Sleep Hexes in a row like that was hard even for her,
//and she couldn’t get off a third before -

// 12081
//The last bully shouted “__Protego!__” and was surrounded by a shimmering
//blue glow.

// 12082
//Twenty-four hours ago, Hermione would have panicked at that, a __real__
//Shielding Charm would let the bully-boy cast spells on her even while he was
//protected.

// 12083
//__Now__ she -

// 12084
//“__Stupefy!__” shouted the bully-boy.

// 12085
//The crimson bolt blasted toward her with a terrible brilliance, blazing far
//brighter than any hex that had sprung from Harry’s wand.

// 12086
//Hermione swayed slightly to the left, and the bolt missed, because the bully’s
//__aim__ hadn’t been nearly as good as Harry’s; and the thought came to her
//that maybe bullies and Professor Quirrell’s armies didn’t mix.

// 12087
//“__Stupefy!__” shouted the bully-boy again. ”__Expelliarmus!
//Stupefy!__”

// 12088
//Anyway, __now__ she’d just spent a whole hour thinking of all the
//__other__ spells she could’ve cast on Harry and Neville -

// 12089
//“__Jellyfy!__” yelled the bully-boy, a wide-beam jinx with no visible bolt
//to dodge, and her knees suddenly felt almost too weak to support her. And then,
//with an angry roar producing an even brighter blaze of crimson,
//”__Stupefy!__”

// 12090
//She dodged that one by deliberately falling, and by then she’d recovered enough
//for her next spell, which was -

// 12091
//“__Glisseo,__” said Hermione, directing her remark to the floor.

// 12092
//“Oof,” said the bully-boy as his feet went out from under him and __he
//actually dropped his wand.__

// 12093
//The __Protego__ winked out.

// 12094
//“__Somnium,__” said Hermione.

// 12095
//She was still breathing in gasps as she crawled over to where the Hufflepuff
//boy was sitting up, and groaning and rubbing his skull where he’d been dropped
//head-first into the floor; it was a good thing he hadn’t been a Muggle,
//Hermione realized, or he might have snapped his neck. She hadn’t actually
//thought of that.

// 12096
//“Uh,” said the boy, his hair was of a color that would’ve been called
//‘brunette’ if he was a girl, his eyes an undistinguished brown that somehow
//seemed just right for Hufflepuff, there weren’t any tears on his face but he
//looked sort of pale. She pegged him at about fourth year, or third.

// 12097
//Then the brown eyes widened as he focused on her. “__General Sunshine?__”

// 12098
//“Yeah,” she said. “That’s __(gasp)__ me.” If the Hufflepuff boy said
//anything about her being Harry Potter’s love interest, she decided, he was
//going to die.

// 12099
//“Wow,” said the Hufflepuff boy. “That was - you just - I mean I saw you on the
//screens before Christmas but - wow! I can’t believe you just did that!”

// 12100
//There was a pause.

// 12101
//__I can’t believe I just did that,__ thought Hermione Granger, who was
//feeling a little faint all of a sudden, it must have been all that running.
//“Excuse __(gasp)__ me,” she said, “can you __(gasp)__ Unjellyfy my
//legs?”

// 12102
//The boy nodded, pushed himself to his feet, and reached inside his robes for
//his wand; but Hermione had to correct his gesture before the counter-Jinx
//worked right.

// 12103
//“I’m Michael Hopkins,” said the boy once Hermione had rolled back to her own
//feet. He stuck out his hand. “Or just Mike inside Hufflepuff, there aren’t any
//other Mikes in all of Hufflepuff this year, would you believe it?”

// 12104
//They shook hands, and Mike said, “Anyway, __thank you.__”

// 12105
//Hermione wasn’t prepared for the rush of euphoria that hit her then, saving
//someone like that literally felt better than anything she’d ever felt in her
//__whole life.__

// 12106
//She turned to look at the bullies.

// 12107
//They were very big and they looked, she thought, around fifteen years old, and
//she was suddenly realizing just how __large__ a difference had sprung up
//between Hogwarts students who’d signed up for all of Professor Quirrell’s
//extra-curricular activities, and students who’d had years of being taught by
//the worst Professors ever to go Professing. Being able to __hit__ things
//that you aimed at, for example; or being able to think well enough in the
//middle of a fight to realize that you ought to __Innervate__ your fallen
//allies. And other things Professor Quirrell had said, like that in the real
//world almost any fight would be settled by a surprise attack, suddenly made a
//lot more sense to her.

// 12108
//Still trying to catch her breath, she looked back at Mike.

// 12109
//“Would you __(gasp)__ believe,” said Hermione Granger, “that five minutes
//ago I was __(gasp) __having trouble figuring out how to become a
//__(gasp)__ hero?”

// 12110
//Had she really thought she needed __permission__ from someone, or that
//heroes sat around waiting for someone else to give them quests? It was very
//simple actually, you just went where the evil was, that was all it ever took to
//be a hero. She should’ve remembered, she shouldn’t have needed a phoenix to
//tell her, that bad things sometimes happened right here in Hogwarts.

// 12111
//Then Hermione glanced nervously back at where the three older boys were lying
//unconscious as the realization hit that they’d __seen__ her, they might
//__know__ who she was, they might sneak up on her and take __her__ by
//surprise and - and they could really hurt her -

// 12112
//Hermione stopped.

// 12113
//She remembered that Harry Potter had put himself in the middle of __five__
//Slytherin bullies on the first day of class when he hadn’t even known how to
//use his wand.

// 12114
//She remembered the Headmaster saying that you grew up by being put in grownup
//situations, and that most people lived their lives inside a constraining circle
//of fear.

// 12115
//And she remembered Professor McGonagall’s voice saying, ‘You __are__
//twelve.’

// 12116
//Hermione took a deep breath, once, twice, and three times.

// 12117
//She asked Mike if he needed to go to Madam Pomfrey’s office, which he didn’t;
//and got him to tell her the names of the Slytherin boys, just in case.

// 12118
//And then Hermione Granger strolled away from the heap of unconscious bullies,
//making sure to put a smile on her face as she walked.

// 12119
//She knew that she was probably going to get hurt sooner or later. But if you
//were too scared of getting hurt to do what was right, then you couldn’t be a
//hero, it was as simple as that; and if you’d put the Sorting Hat on her head at
//that moment it wouldn’t have waited even __one__ __second__ before
//calling out ‘GRYFFINDOR!’

// 12120
//She was still thinking about it when she came down to dinner; the euphoria of
//saving someone still hadn’t worn off, and she was beginning to worry that it
//had broken something in her brain.

// 12121
//As she approached the Ravenclaw table a sudden epidemic of whispers broke out,
//and Hermione wondered if the Hufflepuff boy had said anything yet before she
//realized that the whispers probably weren’t about __that.__

// 12122
//She sat down across from Harry Potter who looked __extremely__ nervous,
//probably because she was still smiling.

// 12123
//“Uh -” said Harry, as she served herself freshly toasted bread, butter,
//cinnamon, no fruits or vegetables whatsoever, and three helpings of chocolate
//brownies. “Uh -”

// 12124
//She let him go on like that until she’d finished pouring herself a glass of
//grapefruit juice, and then she said, “I’ve got a question for you, Mr. Potter.
//How do you think people fail to become themselves?”

// 12125
//“__What?__” said Harry.

// 12126
//She looked at him. “Pretend there isn’t all this stuff going on,” she said,
//“and just say whatever you’d have said yesterday.”

// 12127
//“Um…” Harry said, looking very confused and worried. “I think we already
//__are__ ourselves… it’s not like I’m an imperfect copy of someone else.
//But I guess if I try to run with the sense of the question, then I’d say that
//people don’t become themselves because we absorb all this crazy stuff from the
//environment and then regurgitate it. I mean, how many people playing Quidditch
//would be playing a game like that if they’d invented the game themselves? Or
//back in Muggle Britain, how many people who think of themselves as Labour or
//Conservative or Liberal Democrat would invent that exact bundle of political
//beliefs if they had to come up with everything themselves?”

// 12128
//Hermione considered this. She’d been wondering if Harry would say something
//Slytherin or maybe even Gryffindor, but this didn’t seem to fit into the
//Headmaster’s list; and it occurred to Hermione that there might be a lot more
//viewpoints on the subject than just four.

// 12129
//“Okay,” said Hermione, “different question. What makes someone a hero?”

// 12130
//“A __hero?__” said Harry.

// 12131
//“Yeah,” said Hermione.

// 12132
//“Ah…” Harry said. His fork and knife nervously sawed at a piece of steak,
//cutting it into tinier and tinier pieces. “I think a lot of people can do
//things when the world channels them into it… like people are expecting you to
//do it, or it only uses skills you already know, or there’s an authority
//watching to catch your mistakes and make sure you do your part. But problems
//like that are probably already being solved, you know, and then there’s no need
//for heroes. So I think the people we call ‘heroes’ are rare because they’ve got
//to make everything up as they go along, and most people aren’t comfortable with
//that. Why do you ask?” Harry’s fork stabbed three pieces of thoroughly shredded
//steak and lifted them up to his mouth.

// 12133
//“Oh, I just stunned three older Slytherin bullies and rescued a Hufflepuff,”
//said Hermione. “I’m going to be a hero.”

// 12134
//When Harry had finished choking on his food (some of the other Ravenclaws in
//hearing distance were still coughing) he said, “__What?__”

// 12135
//Hermione told the story, it began rippling out in further whispers even as she
//spoke. (Though she left out the part about the phoenix, because that seemed
//like a private thing between the two of them. Hermione had felt surprised,
//thinking about it afterward, that a phoenix would appear for someone who
//__wanted __to be a hero; it seemed a bit selfish when she thought about it
//that way; but maybe it didn’t matter to phoenixes so long as they saw that you
//were willing to help people.)

// 12136
//When she was done talking, Harry stared at her across the table and didn’t say
//a word.

// 12137
//“I’m sorry for how I acted earlier,” Hermione said. She sipped from her glass
//of grapefruit juice. “I should’ve remembered that if I’m still beating the
//pants off you in Charms class then it’s okay for you to do better in Defense.”

// 12138
//“__Please__ don’t take this the wrong way,” said Harry. He looked
//too-adult now, and grim. “But are you sure this is who __you__ are, and
//not, to put it bluntly, me?”

// 12139
//“I’m quite certain,” said Hermione. “Why, my name practically spells out
//‘heroine’ except for the extra ‘m’, I never noticed that until today.”

// 12140
//“Being a hero isn’t all fun and games,” said Harry. “Not real heroing, the sort
//grownups have to do, it isn’t like this, it isn’t going to be this easy.”

// 12141
//“I know,” said Hermione.

// 12142
//“It’s hard and it’s painful and you’ve got to make decisions where there isn’t
//any good answer -”

// 12143
//“Yes, Harry, I read those books too.”

// 12144
//“No,” said Harry, “you don’t understand, even if the books warn you there’s no
//way you __can__ understand until -”

// 12145
//“That doesn’t stop you,” said Hermione. “It doesn’t stop you even a little. I
//bet you never even __considered__ not being a hero because of that. So why
//d’you think it’ll stop me?”

// 12146
//There was a pause.

// 12147
//A sudden huge smile lit Harry’s face, a smile that was as bright and as boyish
//as the frown had been grim and adult, and everything was all right again
//between them.

// 12148
//“This is going to go horribly mind-bogglingly wrong somehow,” said Harry, still
//smiling hugely. “You know that, right?”

// 12149
//“Oh, I know,” said Hermione. She ate another bite of toast. “That reminds me,
//Dumbledore refused to be my mysterious old wizard, is there someplace I can
//write to get another one?”

// 12150
//__Aftermath:__

// 12151
//“…and Professor Flitwick says her determination seems unshakeable,” Minerva
//said tightly, staring at the silver-bearded old wizard who was responsible for
//this. Albus Dumbledore was just sitting silently and listening to her with a
//distant sad look in his eyes. “Miss Granger didn’t even blink when Professor
//Flitwick threatened to have her transferred to Gryffindor, just said that if
//she left she would take all the books with her. Hermione Granger has decided
//she’s going to be a hero and she’s not taking no for an answer. I doubt you
//could have pushed her into this any harder if you had __tried__ to -”

// 12152
//It took all of five full seconds for Minerva’s brain to process the
//realization.

// 12153
//__“ALBUS!”__ she shrieked.

// 12154
//“My dear,” said the old wizard, “after you have dealt with your thirtieth hero
//or so, you will realize that they react quite predictably to certain things;
//such as being told that they are too young, or that they are not destined to be
//heroes, or that being a hero is unpleasant; and if you truly wish to be sure
//you should tell them all three. Although,” with a brief sigh, “it does not do
//to be __too__ blatant, or your Deputy Headmistress might catch you.”

// 12155
//“Albus,” Minerva said, her voice even tighter, “if she is hurt, I swear this
//time I’ll -”

// 12156
//“She would have come to that same place in due time,” Albus said, the distant
//sad look still in his eyes. “If someone is meant to become a hero then they
//will not listen to our warnings, Minerva, no matter how hard we try. And given
//that, it is better for Harry if Miss Granger does not fall too far behind him.”
//Albus produced, as though from nowhere, a tin which flipped open to reveal
//small yellow lumps, she’d never been able to figure out where he kept it and
//she’d never been able to detect the magic involved. “Lemon drop?”

// 12157
//“__She is a twelve-year-old girl, Albus!__”

// 12158
//__Afteraftermath:__

// 12159
//Within the windows, barely visible in the evening gloom, fishes swam in the
//black waters; illuminated by the bright shine of the Slytherin common room as
//they came closer, fading into darkness as they swam away.

// 12160
//Daphne Greengrass was sitting in a comfortable black leather couch, her head
//collapsed into her hands, glowing golden-yellowish as bright sparks of white
//light winked in and out of existence around her.

// 12161
//She’d been ready to be teased about liking Neville Longbottom. She’d been
//expecting to hear a lot of snide remarks about Hufflepuffs. She’d thought of
//whole __reams__ of snappy comebacks for it while she was on the way back
//to the Slytherin dungeons.

// 12162
//She’d been looking __forward__ to being teased about liking Neville. Being
//teased about that sort of thing meant you’d grown up into a real girl.

// 12163
//As it turned out, nobody had worked out that her challenging Neville to a Most
//Ancient Duel meant that she liked him. She’d thought it would be
//__obvious__ but no, nobody else had even thought of that apparently.

// 12164
//It was always the hex you didn’t see that hit you.

// 12165
//She should’ve just called herself Daphne of Sunshine, like Neville of Chaos. Or
//Sunny Daphne like Sunny Ron. Or __anything__ except Greengrass of
//Sunshine.

// 12166
//Greengrass of Sunshine.

// 12167
//It had gone from there to Greengrass of Sunshine and Blue Skies.

// 12168
//Then someone had added Snow-Topped Mountains and Frolicking Woodland Creatures.

// 12169
//Currently she was being referred to as the Sparkly Unicorn Princess of the
//Noble and Most Ancient House of Sparklypoo.

// 12170
//And some cursed sixth-year girl had hit her with a Sparkling Jinx, she hadn’t
//even known there __was__ such a thing as a Sparkling Jinx, and
//__Finite Incantatem__ hadn’t worked, and she’d asked older girls who she’d
//__thought__ were her friends (she had apparently been wrong about this)
//and then she’d threatened the caster with grievous political mayhem wreaked by
//her father and nonetheless Daphne Greengrass was still sitting in the Slytherin
//common room with her head in her hands, sparkling brightly and wondering how
//she’d ended up as the only sane person in Hogwarts.

// 12171
//It was __after dinnertime__ and they were__ still at it__ and if they
//didn’t stop by tomorrow morning she was going to transfer to Durmstrang and
//become the next Dark Lady.

// 12172
//“Hey, everyone!” said the Carrow twins dramatically, waving an issue of the
//__Daily Prophet.__ “Did you hear the news? The Wizengamot just ruled that
//‘let’s see what you got’ constitutes a lawful challenge to be fought until the
//challenger lies down and has a nap!”

// 12173
//“How dare you insult the honor of the Sparkly Unicorn Princess!” shouted
//Tracey. “Let’s see what you got!” Then Tracey lay down flat on her sofa and
//started snoring loudly.

// 12174
//Daphne’s sparkling head sank further into her glowing hands. “After my family
//takes over I’m going to have you all put under anti-Apparition jinxes and
//Flooed into the sea,” she said to no one in particular. “You’re all okay with
//that, right?”

// 12175
//__Thunk-thunk, thunk-thunk-thunk, thunk.__

// 12176
//Daphne looked up, surprised; that was a Sunshine code-signal -

// 12177
//“__I hight someone knocking!__” bellowed Mr. Goyle. ”__Knocking of
//the door!__”

// 12178
//“__Let’s see what you’ve got, door!__” shouted an older boy near the door,
//and yanked the door open.

// 12179
//There was a moment of complete surprise.

// 12180
//“I’ve come to have a word with Miss Greengrass,” said the Sunshine General,
//sounding like she was trying to sound confident. “Could someone please -”

// 12181
//From the look on Hermione’s face she had just noticed Daphne sparkling.

// 12182
//And __that__ was when Millicent Bulstrode raced up from the lower dorms
//and shouted, “Hey, everyone, guess what, now __Granger__ went and beat up
//Derrick and what’s left of his crew, and his father owled him and said that if
//he didn’t -”

// 12183
//Millicent caught sight of Hermione standing in the doorway.

// 12184
//There was a very loud silence.

// 12185
//“Uh,” said Daphne. __What?__ said her brain. “Uh, what’re you doing here,
//General?”

// 12186
//“Well,” said Hermione Granger with a strange smile on her face, “I’ve decided
//it’s not fair if mysterious old wizards give some people a chance to be heroes
//and not others, and also I’ve read history books and there aren’t nearly enough
//girl heroes in them. So I thought I’d just drop by and see if you wanted to be
//a hero and why are you glowing like that?”

// 12187
//There was another silence.

// 12188
//“This,” said Daphne, “was probably __not__ the best time to ask me that
//question -”

// 12189
//“__I’ll take it!__” shouted Tracey Davis, leaping off her sofa.

// 12190
//And thus was born the Society for the Promotion of Heroic Equality for Witches.
