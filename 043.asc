// 7910
//== Humanism, Pt 1

// 7911
//The gentle sun of January shone on the cold fields outside Hogwarts.

// 7912
//For some of the students it was a study hour, and others had been let out of
//class. The first-years who’d signed up for it were practicing a certain spell,
//a spell that was most advantageously learned outdoors, beneath the bright sun
//and a clear blue sky, rather than within the confines of any classroom. Cookies
//and lemonade were also considered helpful.

// 7913
//The early gestures of the spell were complex and precise; you twitched your
//wand once, twice, thrice, and four times with small tilts at exactly the right
//relative angles, you shifted your forefinger and thumb exactly the right
//distances…

// 7914
//The Ministry thought this meant it was futile to try and teach anyone the spell
//before their fifth year. There had been a few known cases of younger children
//learning it, and this had been dismissed as “genius”.

// 7915
//It might not have been a very polite way of putting it, but Harry was beginning
//to see why Professor Quirrell had claimed that the Ministry Committee of
//Curriculum would have been of greater benefit to wizardkind if they had been
//used as landfill.

// 7916
//So the gestures were complicated and delicate. That didn’t stop you from
//learning it when you were eleven. It meant you had to be extra careful and
//practice each part for a lot longer than usual, that was all.

// 7917
//Most Charms that could only be learned by older students were like that because
//they required more strength of magic than any young student could muster. But
//the Patronus Charm __wasn’t__ like that, it wasn’t difficult because it
//needed too much magic, it was difficult because it took __more__ than mere
//magic.

// 7918
//It took the warm, happy feelings that you kept close in your heart, the loving
//memories, a different kind of strength that you didn’t need for ordinary
//spells.

// 7919
//Harry twitched his wand once, twice, thrice and four times, shifted his fingers
//exactly the right distances…

// 7920
//__“Good luck at school, Harry. Do you think I bought you enough books?”__

// 7921
//__“You can never have enough books… but you certainly tried, it was a
//really, really, really good try…”__

// 7922
//It had brought tears to his eyes, the first time Harry had remembered and tried
//to put it into the spell.

// 7923
//Harry brought the wand up and around and brandished it, a gesture that didn’t
//have to be precise, only bold and defiant.

// 7924
//“__Expecto Patronum!__” cried Harry.

// 7925
//Nothing happened.

// 7926
//Not a single flicker of light.

// 7927
//When Harry looked up, Remus Lupin was still studying the wand, a rather
//troubled look on his faintly scarred face.

// 7928
//Finally Remus shook his head. “I’m sorry, Harry,” the man said quietly. “Your
//wandwork was exactly right.”

// 7929
//And there wasn’t a flicker of light anywhere else, either, because all the
//other first-years who were supposed to be practicing their Patronus Charms had
//been glancing out of the corners of their eyes at Harry instead.

// 7930
//The tears were threatening to come back into Harry’s eyes, and they weren’t
//happy tears. Of all the things, of all the things, Harry had never expected
//this.

// 7931
//There was something horribly humiliating about being informed that you weren’t
//happy enough.

// 7932
//What did Anthony Goldstein have inside him that Harry didn’t, that made
//Anthony’s wand shine with that bright light?

// 7933
//Did Anthony love his own father more?

// 7934
//“What thought were you using to cast it?” said Remus.

// 7935
//“My father,” Harry said, his voice trembling. “I asked him to buy me some books
//before I came to Hogwarts, and he did, and they were expensive, and then he
//asked me if they were enough -”

// 7936
//Harry didn’t try to explain about the Verres family motto.

// 7937
//“Take a rest before you try a different thought, Harry,” said Remus. He
//gestured toward where some other students were sitting on the ground, looking
//disappointed or embarrassed or regretful. “You won’t be able to cast a Patronus
//Charm while you’re feeling ashamed of not being grateful enough.” There was a
//gentle compassion in Mr. Lupin’s voice, and for a moment, Harry felt like
//hitting something.

// 7938
//Instead Harry turned around, and stalked to where the other failures were
//sitting. The other students whose wandwork had also been proclaimed perfect,
//and who were now supposed to be searching for happier thoughts; by the looks of
//them they weren’t making much progress. There were many robes there trimmed in
//dark blue, and a handful of red, and one lone Hufflepuff girl who was still
//crying. The Slytherins hadn’t even bothered showing up, except for Daphne
//Greengrass and Tracey Davis, who were still trying to get the gestures.

// 7939
//Harry plopped down on the cold dead grass of winter, next to the student whose
//failure had surprised him the most.

// 7940
//“So you couldn’t do it either,” Hermione said. She’d fled the field at first,
//but she’d come back after that, and you had to look closely at her reddened
//eyes to see that she’d been crying.

// 7941
//“I,” Harry said, “I, I’d probably feel a lot worse about that if you hadn’t
//failed, you’re the nicest, person I know, that I’ve ever met, Hermione, and if
//__you__ also can’t do it, it means I might still be, be good…”

// 7942
//“I should have gone to Gryffindor,” Hermione whispered. She blinked hard a few
//times, but she didn’t wipe her eyes.

// 7943
//The boy and the girl walked forward together, definitely not holding hands, but
//each drawing a kind of strength from the other’s presence, something that let
//them ignore the whispers of their year-mates, as they walked through the
//hallway approaching the great doors of Hogwarts.

// 7944
//Harry hadn’t been able to cast the Patronus Charm no matter what happy thought
//he tried. People hadn’t seemed surprised by that, which made it even worse.
//Hermione hadn’t been able to do it either. People had been __very__
//surprised by that, and Harry had seen her starting to get the same sidelong
//looks as him. The other Ravenclaws who’d failed weren’t getting those looks.
//But Hermione was the Sunshine General, and her fans were treating it like she’d
//failed them, somehow, like she’d betrayed a promise she’d never made.

// 7945
//The two of them had gone to the library to research the Patronus Charm, which
//was Hermione’s way of dealing with distress, as it was sometimes also Harry’s.
//Study, learn, try to understand __why…__

// 7946
//The books had confirmed what the Headmaster had told Harry; often, wizards who
//couldn’t cast the Patronus Charm in practice would be able to do so in the
//presence of a real Dementor, going from flat failure all the way to a full
//corporeal Patronus. It defied all logic, the Dementor’s aura of fear ought to
//make it __harder__ to wield a happy thought; but that was the way it was.

// 7947
//So the two of them were both going to give it one last try, there was no way
//either of them wouldn’t give it one last try.

// 7948
//It was the day the Dementor came to Hogwarts.

// 7949
//Earlier, Harry had unTransfigured his father’s rock from where it usually
//rested on his pinky ring in the form of a tiny diamond, and placed the huge
//gray stone back into his pouch. Just in case Harry’s magic failed entirely,
//when he confronted the darkest of all creatures.

// 7950
//Harry had already started to feel pessimistic, and he wasn’t even in front of a
//Dementor yet.

// 7951
//“I bet you can do it and I can’t,” Harry said in a whisper. “I bet that’s what
//happens.”

// 7952
//“It felt wrong to me,” Hermione said, her voice even quieter than his. “I tried
//it this morning and I realized. When I was doing the brandish at the end, even
//before I said the words, it felt wrong.”

// 7953
//Harry didn’t say anything. He’d felt the same thing, right from the start,
//though it had taken another five attempts using five other happy thoughts
//before he’d been able to acknowledge it to himself. Every time he tried to
//brandish his wand, it had felt hollow; the spell he was trying to learn didn’t
//fit him.

// 7954
//“It doesn’t mean we’re going to be Dark Wizards,” said Harry. “Lots of people
//who can’t cast the Patronus Charm aren’t Dark Wizards. Godric Gryffindor wasn’t
//a Dark Wizard…”

// 7955
//Godric had defeated Dark Lords, fought to protect commoners from Noble Houses
//and Muggles from wizards. He’d had many fine friends and true, and lost no more
//than half of them in one good cause or another. He’d listened to the screams of
//the wounded, in the armies he’d raised to defend the innocent; young wizards of
//courage had rallied to his calls, and he’d buried them afterward. Until
//finally, when his wizardry had only just begun to fail him in his old age, he’d
//brought together the three other most powerful wizards of his era to raise
//Hogwarts from the bare ground; the one great accomplishment to Godric’s name
//that wasn’t about war, any kind of war, no matter how just. It was Salazar, and
//not Godric, who’d taught the first Hogwarts class in Battle Magic. Godric had
//taught the first Hogwarts class in Herbology, the magics of green growing life.

// 7956
//To his last day he’d never been able to cast the Patronus Charm.

// 7957
//Godric Gryffindor had been a good man, not a happy one.

// 7958
//Harry didn’t believe in angst, he couldn’t stand reading about whiny heroes, he
//knew a billion other people in the world would have given anything to trade
//places with him, and…

// 7959
//And on his deathbed, Godric had told Helga (for Salazar had abandoned him, and
//Rowena passed before) that he didn’t regret any of it, and he was __not__
//warning his students not to follow in his footsteps, no one was __ever__
//to say he’d told anyone not to follow in his footsteps. If it had been the
//right thing for __him__ to do, then he wouldn’t tell anyone else to choose
//wrongly, not even the youngest student in Hogwarts. And yet for those who
//__did__ follow in his footsteps, he hoped they would remember that
//Gryffindor had told his House that it was all right for them to be happier than
//him. That red and gold would be bright warm colors, from now on.

// 7960
//And Helga had promised him, weeping, that when she was Headmistress she would
//make sure of it.

// 7961
//Whereupon Godric had died, and left no ghost behind him; and Harry had shoved
//the book back to Hermione and walked away a little, so she wouldn’t see him
//crying.

// 7962
//You wouldn’t think that a book with an innocent title like “The Patronus Charm:
//Wizards Who Could and Couldn’t” would be the saddest book Harry had ever read.

// 7963
//Harry…

// 7964
//Harry didn’t want that.

// 7965
//To be in that book.

// 7966
//Harry didn’t want that.

// 7967
//The rest of the school just seemed to think that __No Patronus__ meant
//__Bad Person,__ plain and simple. Somehow the fact that Godric Gryffindor
//also hadn’t been able to cast the Patronus Charm seemed not to get repeated.
//Maybe people didn’t talk about it to respect his last wish, Fred and George
//probably didn’t know and Harry certainly wasn’t about to tell them. Or maybe
//the other failures didn’t mention it because it was less shameful, the smaller
//loss of pride and status, to be thought Dark rather than unhappy.

// 7968
//Harry saw that Hermione, beside him, was blinking hard; and he wondered if she
//was thinking of Rowena Ravenclaw, who’d also loved books.

// 7969
//“Okay,” Harry whispered. “Happier thoughts. If you do go to a full corporeal
//Patronus, what do you think your animal will be?”

// 7970
//“An otter,” Hermione said at once.

// 7971
//“An __otter?__” Harry whispered incredulously.

// 7972
//“Yes, an otter,” said Hermione. “What about yours?”

// 7973
//“Peregrine falcon,” Harry said without hesitation. “It can dive faster than
//three hundred kilometers per hour, it’s the fastest living creature there is.”
//The peregrine falcon had been Harry’s favorite animal since forever. Harry was
//determined to become an Animagus someday, just to get that as his form, and fly
//by the strength of his own wings, and see the land below with sharper eyes…
//“But why an __otter?__”

// 7974
//Hermione smiled, but didn’t say anything.

// 7975
//And the vast doors of Hogwarts swung open.

// 7976
//They walked for a time, the children, over a pathway that led toward the
//unforbidden forest, and continued through the forest itself. The Sun was
//lowering to near the horizon, the shadows long, the sunlight filtered through
//the bare branches of the winter trees; for it was January, and the first-years
//the last to learn, that day.

// 7977
//Then the path swerved and took a new direction, and they all saw it in the
//distance, the clearing in the forest, and the sere winter grounds, yellowing
//dried grass whitened by a few small remnants of snow.

// 7978
//The human figures still small at that range. The two spots of dim white light
//from the Aurors’ Patronuses, and the brighter spot of silver light from the
//Headmaster’s, next to something…

// 7979
//Harry squinted.

// 7980
//Something…

// 7981
//It must have been purely Harry’s imagination, because there shouldn’t have been
//any way for a Dementor to reach past three corporeal Patronuses, but he thought
//he could feel a touch of emptiness brushing at his mind, brushing straight at
//the soft inner center of himself without any respect for Occlumency barriers.

// 7982
//Seamus Finnigan was ashen and trembling as he rejoined the students milling
//about on the withered and snow-spotted grass. Seamus’s Patronus Charm had been
//successful, but there was still that interval between when the Headmaster
//dispelled his own Patronus and when you were supposed to cast your own, when
//you faced the Dementor’s fear unshielded.

// 7983
//Up to twenty seconds of exposure at five paces was certainly safe, even for an
//eleven-year-old wizard with weak resistance and a still-maturing brain. There
//was a lot of variance in how hard the Dementor’s power hit people, which was
//another thing not quite understood; but twenty seconds was definitely safe.

// 7984
//Forty seconds of Dementor exposure at five paces might __possibly__ have
//been enough to cause permanent damage, though only to the most sensitive
//subjects.

// 7985
//It was harsh training even by the standards of Hogwarts, where the way you
//learned to fly on a hippogriff was by being tossed on one and told to get
//going. Harry was no fan of overprotectiveness, and if you looked at the
//difference in maturity between a fourth-year in Hogwarts and a
//fourteen-year-old Muggle, it was clear that Muggles were smothering their
//children… but even Harry had started to wonder if this was pushing it. Not
//every hurt could be healed afterward.

// 7986
//But if you couldn’t cast the spell under those conditions, it meant you
//couldn’t rely on using the Patronus Charm to defend yourself; overconfidence
//was even more dangerous to wizards than to Muggles. Dementors could drain your
//magic and your physical vitality, not just your happy thoughts, which meant you
//might __not__ be able to Apparate away if you waited too long, or if you
//didn’t recognize the approaching fear until the Dementor was within range for
//its attack. (During his reading, Harry had discovered with considerable horror
//that some books claimed the Dementor’s Kiss would __eat your soul__ and
//that this was the reason for the permanent mindless coma into which it put the
//victims. And that wizards who __believed this__ had deliberately used the
//Dementor’s Kiss to __execute criminals.__ It was a certainty that some
//called criminals were innocent, and even if they weren’t, __destroying
//their souls?__ If Harry had believed in souls, he would have… drawn a blank, he
//just couldn’t think of an appropriate response to that.)

// 7987
//The Headmaster was taking security seriously, and so were the three Aurors
//standing guard. Their leader was an Asianish-looking man, solemn without being
//grim, Auror Komodo, whose wand never left his hand. His Patronus, an orangutan
//of solid moonlight, paced back and forth between the Dementor and the
//first-years awaiting their turn; beside the orangutan moved the bright white
//panther of Auror Butnaru, a man with a piercing gaze, long black hair in a
//ponytail, and a long braided goatee. Those two Aurors, and their two
//Patronuses, were all watching the Dementor. On the opposite side of the
//students was the resting Auror Goryanof, tall and thin and pale and unshaven,
//sitting back on a chair he’d conjured without word or wand, and maintaining an
//absentminded pokerface as he scanned the entire scene. Professor Quirrell had
//shown up not long after the first-years began their attempts, and his eyes
//never strayed far from Harry. The tiny Professor Flitwick, who had been a
//champion duellist, was fiddling absently with his wand; and __his__ eyes,
//peering out from within the huge puffy beard that served as his face, stayed
//focused on Professor Quirrell.

// 7988
//And it must have been Harry’s imagination, but Professor Quirrell seemed to
//wince slightly each time the Headmaster’s Patronus winked out to test the next
//student. Maybe Professor Quirrell was imagining the same placebo effect as
//Harry, that backwash of emptiness caressing at his mind.

// 7989
//“Anthony Goldstein,” called the voice of the Headmaster.

// 7990
//Harry quietly walked toward Seamus, even as Anthony began to approach the
//shining silver phoenix, and… whatever it was beneath the tattered cloak.

// 7991
//“What did you see?” Harry asked Seamus in a low voice.

// 7992
//A lot of students hadn’t answered Harry, when he’d tried to gather the data;
//but Seamus was Finnigan of Chaos, one of Harry’s lieutenants. Maybe that wasn’t
//fair, but…

// 7993
//“Dead,” said Seamus in a whisper, “grayish and slimy… dead and left in water
//for a while… ”

// 7994
//Harry nodded. “That’s what a lot of people see,” Harry said. He projected
//confidence, even though it was fake, because Seamus needed it. “Go eat some
//chocolate, you’ll feel better.”

// 7995
//Seamus nodded and stumbled off toward the table of healing sweets.

// 7996
//“__Expecto Patronum!__” cried a young boy’s voice.

// 7997
//Then there were gasps of shock, even from the Aurors.

// 7998
//Harry spun around to look -

// 7999
//There was a brilliant silver bird standing between Anthony Goldstein and the
//cage. The bird reared its head and let out a cry, and the cry was also silver,
//as bright and hard and beautiful as metal.

// 8000
//And something in the back of Harry’s mind said, __if that’s a peregrine
//falcon, I’m going to strangle him in his sleep.__

// 8001
//__Shut up,__ Harry said to the thought, __do you want us to be a
//Dark Wizard?__

// 8002
//__What’s the point? You’re going to end up as one eventually.__

// 8003
//That… wasn’t something Harry would usually have thought…

// 8004
//__It’s a placebo effect,__ Harry told himself again. __The Dementor
//can’t actually get to me through three corporeal Patronuses, I’m just imagining
//what I think it’s like. When I actually face the Dementor, it’ll feel
//completely different, and then I’ll know I was just being silly before.__

// 8005
//A slight chill went down Harry’s spine then, because he had a feeling that yes,
//it __would__ be completely different, and not in a positive direction.

// 8006
//The blazing silver phoenix sprang back into existence from the Headmaster’s
//wand, the lesser bird vanished; and Anthony Goldstein began to walk back.

// 8007
//The Headmaster was coming with Anthony instead of calling out the next name,
//the Patronus waiting behind to guard the Dementor.

// 8008
//Harry glanced over to where Hermione was standing, just behind the glowing
//panther. Hermione’s turn would have come next, but had apparently just been
//delayed.

// 8009
//She looked stressed.

// 8010
//Earlier, she’d politely asked Harry to please stop trying to destress her.

// 8011
//Dumbledore was smiling slightly as he escorted Anthony back toward the others;
//smiling only slightly, because the Headmaster looked very, very tired.

// 8012
//“Unbelievable,” said Dumbledore in a voice that sounded much weaker than his
//accustomed boom. “A corporeal Patronus, in his first year. And an astounding
//number of successes among the other young students. Quirinus, I must
//acknowledge that you have proved your point.”

// 8013
//Professor Quirrell inclined his head. “A simple enough guess, I should think. A
//Dementor attacks through fear, and children are less afraid.”

// 8014
//“__Less__ afraid?” said Auror Goryanof from where he was sitting.

// 8015
//“So I said as well,” said Dumbledore. “And Professor Quirrell pointed out that
//adults had more courage, not less to fear; which thought, I confess, had never
//occurred to me before.”

// 8016
//“That was not my __precise__ phrasing,” Professor Quirrell said dryly,
//“but it will do. And the rest of our agreement, Headmaster?”

// 8017
//“As you say,” Dumbledore said reluctantly. “I admit I was not expecting to lose
//that wager, Quirinus, but you have proven your wisdom.”

// 8018
//All the students were looking at them, puzzled; except Hermione, who was
//staring in the direction of the cage and the tall decaying robes; and Harry,
//who was watching everyone, since he was imagining himself feeling paranoid.

// 8019
//Professor Quirrell said, in tones that did not invite further comments, “I am
//allowed to teach the Killing Curse to students who wish to learn it. Which will
//render them considerably safer from Dark Wizards and other pests, and it is
//foolish to think they will otherwise know no deadly magics.” Professor Quirrell
//paused, his eyes narrowing. “Headmaster, I respectfully observe that you are
//not looking well. I suggest leaving the remainder of the day’s task to
//Professor Flitwick.”

// 8020
//Dumbledore shook his head. “We are almost done for the day, Quirinus. I will
//last.”

// 8021
//Hermione had approached Anthony. “Captain Goldstein,” she said, and her voice
//trembled only a little, “can you give me any advice?”

// 8022
//“Don’t be afraid,” Anthony said firmly. “Don’t think about anything it tries to
//make you think about. You’re not just holding up the wand in front of you as a
//shield against the fear, you’re __brandishing__ your wand to drive the
//fear away, that’s how you make a happy thought into something solid…” Anthony
//shrugged helplessly. “I mean, I __heard__ all that before, but…”

// 8023
//Other students were starting to congregate around Anthony, with their own
//questions.

// 8024
//“Miss Granger?” the Headmaster said. His voice might have been gentle, or just
//weakened.

// 8025
//Hermione straightened her shoulders, and followed him.

// 8026
//“What did you see under the cloak?” Harry said to Anthony.

// 8027
//Anthony looked at Harry, surprised, and then answered, “A very tall man who was
//dead, I mean, sort of dead-shaped and dead-colored… it hurt to see him and I
//knew that was the Dementor trying to get at me.”

// 8028
//Harry looked back out at where Hermione was confronting the cage and the cloak.

// 8029
//Hermione raised her wand into position for the first gestures.

// 8030
//The Headmaster’s phoenix winked out of existence.

// 8031
//And Hermione gave a tiny, pathetic shriek, flinched -

// 8032
//- took a step back, Harry could see her wand moving, and then she brandished it
  //and said “Expecto Patronum!”

// 8033
//Nothing happened.

// 8034
//Hermione turned and ran.

// 8035
//“__Expecto Patronum!__” said the Headmaster’s deeper voice, and the silver
//phoenix blazed back to life.

// 8036
//The young girl stumbled, and kept running, strange sounds beginning to come
//from her throat.

// 8037
//“__Hermione!__” Susan yelled it, and Hannah, and Daphne, and Ernie, and
//they all started to run toward her; even as Harry, who was always thinking one
//step ahead, spun on his own heel and ran for the table with the chocolate.

// 8038
//Even after Harry had shoved the chocolate into Hermione’s mouth and she’d
//chewed and swallowed, she was still breathing in great gasps and crying, her
//eyes still seemed unfocused.

// 8039
//__She can’t have been permanently Demented,__ Harry thought desperately at
//the confusion inside him, the horrible fear and deathly fury beginning to twist
//around each other, __she can’t have been, she wasn’t exposed for even ten
//seconds let alone forty -__

// 8040
//But she could be __temporarily__ Demented, as Harry realized in that
//moment, there wasn’t any rule that you couldn’t be __temporarily__ injured
//by a Dementor in just ten seconds if you were sensitive enough.

// 8041
//Then Hermione’s eyes seemed to focus, and dart around, and settle on him.

// 8042
//“Harry,” she gasped, and the other students went silent. “Harry, don’t.
//__Don’t!__”

// 8043
//Harry was suddenly afraid to ask what he shouldn’t do, was __he__ in her
//worst memories, or some sleep’s nightmare that she was now reliving in waking
//life?

// 8044
//“__Don’t go near it!”__ said Hermione. Her hand reached out, grabbed him
//by the lapel of his robes. “You mustn’t go near it, Harry! __It spoke to
//me, Harry, it knows you, it knows you’re here!__”

// 8045
//“What -” Harry said, and then cursed himself for asking.

// 8046
//“__The Dementor!__” said Hermione. Her voice rose to a shriek.
//”__Professor Quirrell wants it to eat you!__”

// 8047
//In the sudden hush, Professor Quirrell came forward a few steps; but he didn’t
//approach any closer (Harry was there, after all). “Miss Granger,” he said, and
//his voice was grave, “I think you should have some more chocolate.”

// 8048
//“__Professor Flitwick, don’t let Harry try, send him back!__”

// 8049
//The Headmaster had arrived by then, and he and Professor Flitwick were
//exchanging worried looks.

// 8050
//“I did not hear the Dementor speak,” the Headmaster said. “Still…”

// 8051
//“Just ask,” said Professor Quirrell, sounding a little weary.

// 8052
//“Did the Dementor say __how__ it would get to Harry?” said the Headmaster.

// 8053
//“All his tastiest parts first,” said Hermione, “it would - it would eat -”

// 8054
//Hermione blinked. Some sanity seemed to come back into her eyes.

// 8055
//Then she started crying.

// 8056
//“You were too brave, Hermione Granger,” the Headmaster said. His voice was
//gentle, and clearly audible. “Too much braver than I comprehended. You should
//have turned and run, not endured and tried to complete your Charm. When you are
//older and stronger, Miss Granger, I know that you will try again, and I know
//that you will succeed.”

// 8057
//“I’m sorry,” Hermione said in gasps, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry… I’m
//sorry, Harry, I can’t tell you what I saw, I didn’t look at it, I didn’t dare
//look at it, I knew it was too horrible to ever be seen…”

// 8058
//It should have been Harry, but he’d hesitated, because his hands were all
//chocolatey; and then Ernie and Susan were there, helping Hermione from where
//she’d fallen on the grass, leading her toward the snacks table.

// 8059
//Five bars of chocolate later, Hermione seemed to be all right again, and she
//went over and apologized to Professor Quirrell; but she was always watching
//Harry, every time that he glanced in her direction. He’d stepped toward her
//only once, and stopped when she’d stepped away. Her eyes had silently
//apologized, and silently pleaded for him to leave her be.

// 8060
//Neville Longbottom had seen something dead and half-dissolved, oozing and
//running with a face like a squashed sponge.

// 8061
//It was the worst thing anyone had yet described seeing. Neville had been able
//to produce a small flicker of light from his wand before, but he had,
//intelligently and with great presence of mind, turned and run away instead of
//trying to cast his own Patronus Charm.

// 8062
//(The Headmaster had said nothing to the other students, told no one else to be
//less brave; but Professor Quirrell had calmly observed that if you made the
//mistake __after__ being warned, that was when ignorance became stupidity.)

// 8063
//“Professor Quirrell?” Harry said in a low voice, having come as close to the
//Defense Professor as he dared. “What do __you__ see when you -”

// 8064
//“Don’t ask.” The voice was very flat.

// 8065
//Harry nodded respectfully. “What was your __original__ phrasing to the
//Headmaster, if I can ask?”

// 8066
//Dryly. “Our worst memories can only grow worse as we grow older.”

// 8067
//“Ah,” Harry said. “Logical.”

// 8068
//Something strange flickered in Professor Quirrell’s eyes, then, as he looked at
//Harry. “Let us hope,” Professor Quirrell said, “that you succeed upon this try,
//Mr. Potter. For if you do, the Headmaster may teach you his trick of using a
//Patronus to send messages that cannot be forged or intercepted, and the
//military importance of that is impossible to overstate. It would be a
//tremendous advantage to the Chaos Legion, and someday, I suspect, this entire
//country. But if you do __not__ succeed, Mr. Potter… well, __I__ shall
//understand.”

// 8069
//Morag MacDougal had said, in a wavering voice, “Ouch”, and Dumbledore had
//recast his Patronus right away.

// 8070
//Parvati Patil had produced a corporeal Patronus in the form of a tiger, larger
//than Dumbledore’s phoenix, though not nearly as bright. There had been a great
//burst of applause from all the watchers, though not the same shock as when
//Anthony had done it.

// 8071
//And then it was Harry’s turn.

// 8072
//The Headmaster called the name of Harry Potter, and Harry was afraid.

// 8073
//Harry knew, he knew that he was going to fail, and he knew that it was going to
//hurt.

// 8074
//But he still had to try; because sometimes, in the presence of a Dementor, a
//wizard went from not a flicker of light to a full corporeal Patronus, and no
//one understood why.

// 8075
//And because if Harry __couldn’t__ defend himself from Dementors, he had to
//be able to recognize their approach, recognize the feeling of them in his mind,
//and run before it was too late.

// 8076
//__What is my worst memory…?__

// 8077
//Harry had expected the Headmaster to give him a worried look, or a hopeful
//look, or deeply wise advice; but instead Albus Dumbledore only watched him with
//quiet calm.

// 8078
//__He thinks I’m going to fail, but he won’t sabotage me by telling me
//so,__ thought Harry, __if he had true words of encouragement to speak, he
//would speak them…__

// 8079
//The cage came closer. It was already tarnished, but not rusted away to nothing,
//not yet.

// 8080
//The cloak came closer. It was unraveling and shot through with unpatched holes;
//it had been new that morning, Auror Goryanof had said.

// 8081
//“Headmaster?” Harry said. “What do you see?”

// 8082
//The Headmaster’s voice was also calm. “The Dementors are creatures of fear, and
//as your fear of the Dementor diminishes, so does the fearsomeness of its form.
//I see a tall, thin, naked man. He is not decaying. He is only slightly painful
//to look upon. That is all. What do you see, Harry?”

// 8083
//…Harry couldn’t see under the cloak.

// 8084
//Or that wasn’t right, it was that his mind was __refusing__ to see what
//was under the cloak…

// 8085
//No, his mind was trying to see the __wrong__ thing under the cloak, Harry
//could feel it, his eyes trying to force a mistake. But Harry had done his best
//to train himself to notice that tiny feeling of confusion, to automatically
//flinch away from making stuff up; and every time his mind tried to start
//inventing a lie about what was under the cloak, that reflex was fast enough to
//shut it down.

// 8086
//Harry looked under the cloak and saw…

// 8087
//An open question. Harry wouldn’t let his mind see something false, and so he
//didn’t see anything, like the part of his visual cortex getting that signal was
//just ceasing to exist. There was a blind spot under the cloak. Harry couldn’t
//know what was under there.

// 8088
//Just that it was far worse than any decaying mummy.

// 8089
//The unseeable horror beneath the cloak was very close, now, but the blazing
//bird of moonlight, the white phoenix, yet lay between them.

// 8090
//Harry wanted to run away like some of the other students had. Half the ones
//who’d had no luck with their Patronus Charms just hadn’t shown up today in the
//first place. Of those remaining, half had fled before the Headmaster had even
//dispelled his own Patronus, and no one had said a word. There’d been a little
//laughter when Terry had turned and walked back before his own try; and Susan
//and Hannah, who’d gone before, had yelled at everyone to shut up.

// 8091
//But Harry was the Boy-Who-Lived, and he would lose much respect if he was seen
//to give up without even trying…

// 8092
//Pride and roles seemed to diminish and fall away, in the presence of whatever
//lay beneath the cloak.

// 8093
//__Why am I still here?__

// 8094
//It wasn’t the shame of others thinking him cowardly, that kept Harry’s feet in
//place.

// 8095
//It wasn’t the hope of repairing his reputation that brought up his wand.

// 8096
//It wasn’t the desire to master the Patronus Charm as magic, that moved his
//fingers into the initial position.

// 8097
//It was something else, something that __had__ to oppose whatever lay
//beneath the cloak, this was the true darkness and Harry had to find out whether
//it lay within him, the power to drive it back.

// 8098
//Harry had planned to try one final time to think of his book-shopping spree
//with his father, but instead, at the last minute, facing the Dementor, a
//different memory occurred to him, something he hadn’t tried before; a thought
//that wasn’t warm and happy in the ordinary way, but felt righter, somehow.

// 8099
//And Harry remembered the stars, remembered them burning terribly bright and
//unwavering in the Silent Night; he let that image fill him, fill all of him
//like an Occlumency barrier across his entire mind, became once again the
//bodiless awareness of the void.

// 8100
//The bright silver shining phoenix vanished.

// 8101
//And the Dementor smashed into his mind like the fist of God.

// 8102
//**FEAR / COLD / DARKNESS**

// 8103
//There was an instant when the two forces clashed head-on, when the peaceful
//starlit memory held its own against the fear, even as Harry’s fingers began the
//wand motions, practiced until they had become automatic. They weren’t warm and
//happy, those blazing points of light in perfect blackness; but it was an image
//the Dementor could not easily pierce. For the silent burning stars were vast
//and unafraid, and to shine in the cold and darkness was their natural state.

// 8104
//But there was a flaw, a crack, a fault-line in the immovable object trying to
//resist that irresistible force. Harry felt a twinge of anger at the Dementor
//for trying to feed on him, and it was like slipping on wet ice. Harry’s mind
//began to slide sideways, into bitterness, black fury, deathly hatred -

// 8105
//Harry’s wand came up in the final brandish.

// 8106
//It felt wrong.

// 8107
//“Expecto Patronum,” his voice spoke, the words hollow and pointless.

// 8108
//And Harry fell into his dark side, fell down into his dark side, further and
//faster and deeper than ever before, down down down as the slide accelerated, as
//the Dementor latched onto the exposed and vulnerable parts and fed on them,
//eating away the light. A fading reflex scrabbled for warmth, but even as an
//image of Hermione came to him, or an image of Mum and Dad, the Dementor twisted
//it, showed him Hermione lying dead on the ground, the corpses of his mother and
//father, and then even that was sucked away.

// 8109
//Into the vacuum rose the memory, the worst memory, something forgotten so long
//ago that the neural patterns shouldn’t have still existed.

// 8110
//__“Lily, take Harry and go! It’s him!” shouted a man’s voice. “Go! Run!
//I’ll hold him off!”__

// 8111
//__And Harry couldn’t help but think, in the empty depths of his dark
//side, how ridiculously overconfident James Potter had been. Hold off Lord
//Voldemort? With what?__

// 8112
//__Then the other voice spoke, high-pitched like the hiss of a teakettle,
//and it was like dry ice laid on Harry’s every nerve, like a brand of metal
//cooled to liquid helium temperatures and laid on every part of him. And the
//voice said:__

// 8113
//__“Avadakedavra.”__

// 8114
//(The wand flew from the boy’s nerveless fingers as his body began to convulse
//and fall, the Headmaster’s eyes widening in alarm as he began his own Patronus
//Charm.)

// 8115
//__“Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!” screamed the woman’s voice.__

// 8116
//__Whatever was left of Harry listened with all the light drained out of
//him, in the dead void of his heart, and wondered if she thought that Lord
//Voldemort would stop because she asked politely.__

// 8117
//__“Step aside, woman!” said the shrill voice of burning cold. “For you I
//am not come, only the boy.”__

// 8118
//__“Not Harry! Please… have mercy… have mercy…”__

// 8119
//__Lily Potter, Harry thought, seemed not to understand what type of
//people became Dark Lords in the first place; and if this was the best strategy
//she could conceive to save her child’s life, that was her final failure as a
//mother.__

// 8120
//__“I give you this rare chance to flee,” said the shrill voice. “But I
//will not trouble myself to subdue you, and your death here will not save your
//child. Step aside, foolish woman, if you have any sense in you at all!”__

// 8121
//__“Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead!”__

// 8122
//__The empty thing that was Harry wondered if Lily Potter seriously
//imagined that Lord Voldemort would say yes, kill her, and then depart leaving
//her son unharmed.__

// 8123
//__“Very well,” said the voice of death, now sounding coldly amused, “I
//accept the bargain. Yourself to die, and the child to live. Now drop your wand
//so that I can murder you.”__

// 8124
//__There was a hideous silence.__

// 8125
//__Lord Voldemort began to laugh, horrible contemptuous laughter.__

// 8126
//__And then, at last, Lily Potter’s voice shrieked in desperate hate,
//“Avada ke-”__

// 8127
//__The lethal voice finished first, the curse rapid and precise.__

// 8128
//__“Avadakedavra.”__

// 8129
//__A blinding flare of green marked the end of Lily Potter.__

// 8130
//__And the boy in the crib saw it, the eyes, those two crimson eyes,
//seeming to glow bright red, to blaze like miniature suns, filling Harry’s whole
//vision as they locked to his own -__

// 8131
//The other children saw Harry Potter fall, they heard Harry Potter scream, a
//thin high-pitched scream that seemed to pierce their ears like knives.

// 8132
//There was a brilliant silver flash as the Headmaster bellowed “__Expecto
//Patronum!__” and the blazing phoenix returned to being.

// 8133
//But Harry Potter’s horrible scream went on and on and on, even as the
//Headmaster scooped up the boy in his arms and bore him away from the Dementor,
//even as Neville Longbottom and Professor Flitwick both went for the chocolate
//at the same time and -

// 8134
//Hermione knew it, she knew it as she saw it, she knew that her nightmare had
//been real, it was coming true, somehow it was coming true.

// 8135
//“Get him chocolate!” demanded the voice of Professor Quirrell, pointlessly,
//because Professor Flitwick’s tiny form was already cannonballing toward where
//the Headmaster was racing toward the students.

// 8136
//Hermione was moving forward herself, though she didn’t know what else she meant
//to do -

// 8137
//“__Cast Patronuses!__” shouted the Headmaster, as he brought Harry behind
//the Aurors. ”__Everyone who can! Get them between Harry and the Dementor!
//It’s still feeding on him!__”

// 8138
//There was a moment of frozen horror.

// 8139
//“__Expecto Patronum!__” shouted Professor Flitwick and Auror Goryanof, and
//then Anthony Goldstein, but he failed the first time, and then Parvati Patil,
//who succeeded, and then Anthony tried again and his silver bird spread its
//wings and screamed at the Dementor, and Dean Thomas roared the words like they
//had been written in letters of fire and his wand gave birth to a towering white
//bear; there were eight blazing Patronuses all in a line between Harry and the
//Dementor, and Harry went on screaming and screaming as the Headmaster laid him
//on the dried grass.

// 8140
//Hermione couldn’t cast a Patronus Charm, so she ran toward where Harry lay. In
//her mind, something tried to guess how long it had been already. Was it twenty
//seconds? More?

// 8141
//There was a dreadful agony and bewilderment on the face of Albus Dumbledore.
//His long black wand was in his hand, but he spoke no spells, only looked down
//at Harry’s convulsing body in horror -

// 8142
//Hermione didn’t know what to do, she didn’t know what to do, she didn’t
//understand what was happening, and the most powerful wizard in the world seemed
//equally at a loss.

// 8143
//“__Use your phoenix!__” bellowed Professor Quirrell. ”__Take him far
//away from that Dementor!__”

// 8144
//Without a single word the Headmaster scooped up Harry in his arms and vanished
//in a crack of fire along with the suddenly appearing Fawkes; and the
//Headmaster’s Patronus winked out, where it had guarded the Dementor.

// 8145
//Horror and confusion and sudden babble.

// 8146
//“Mr. Potter should recover,” Professor Quirrell said, raising his voice, but
//his tone now calm once again, “I think it was just over twenty seconds.”

// 8147
//Then the blazing white phoenix appeared again, like it was flying before them
//from elsewhere, to Hermione Granger came the creature of moonlight, and it
//cried to her in Albus Dumbledore’s voice:

// 8148
//“__It still feeds on him, even here! How? If you know, Hermione Granger,
//you must tell me! Tell me!__”

// 8149
//The senior Auror turned to stare at her, and so did many students. Professor
//Flitwick didn’t turn, he was now leveling his wand on Professor Quirrell, who
//was holding out clearly empty hands.

// 8150
//Seconds ticked past, uncounted.

// 8151
//She couldn’t remember it, she couldn’t remember the nightmare clearly, she
//couldn’t remember why she had thought it was possible, why she had been afraid
//-

// 8152
//Hermione realized then what she ought to do, and it was the hardest decision of
//her life.

// 8153
//What if whatever had happened to Harry, happened to her too?

// 8154
//All her limbs cold as death, her vision gone dark, fear overwhelming
//everything; she’d seen Harry dying, Mum and Dad dying, all her friends dying,
//everyone dying, so that in the end, when she died, she would be alone. That was
//her secret nightmare she’d never talked about with anyone, that had given the
//Dementor its power over her, the loneliest thing was to die alone.

// 8155
//She didn’t want to go to that place again, she, she didn’t, she didn’t want to
//stay there forever -

// 8156
//__You have courage enough for Gryffindor,__ said the calm voice of the
//Sorting Hat in her memory, __but you will do what is right in any House I
//give you. You will learn, you will stand by your friends, in any House you
//choose. So don’t be afraid, Hermione Granger, just decide where you belong…__

// 8157
//There was no time for deciding, Harry was dying.

// 8158
//“I can’t remember now,” said Hermione, her voice cracking, “but just hold on,
//I’ll go in front of the Dementor again…”

// 8159
//She started to run toward the Dementor.

// 8160
//“Miss Granger!” squeaked Professor Flitwick, but he made no move to stop her,
//only kept holding his wand on Professor Quirrell.

// 8161
//“__Everyone!__” shouted Auror Komodo in a voice of military command.
//”__Get your Patronuses out of her way!__”

// 8162
//“__FLITWICK!__” roared Professor Quirrell. ”__SUMMON POTTER’S
//WAND!__”

// 8163
//Even as Hermione understood, Professor Flitwick was already crying
//“__Accio!__”, and she saw the stick of wood zooming up from where it had
//lain almost touching the Dementor’s cage.

// 8164
//The eyes opened, dead and vacant.

// 8165
//“__Harry!__” gasped a voice in the colorless world. ”__Harry! Speak
//to me!__”

// 8166
//The face of Albus Dumbledore leaned over into the field of vision, which had
//been occupied by a distant marble ceiling.

// 8167
//“You’re annoying,” said the empty voice. “You should die.”
