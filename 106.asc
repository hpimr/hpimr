//== The Truth, Pt 3

// 18166
//After a single step into Dumbledore’s forbidden chamber, Harry shrieked and
//jumped back and collided with Professor Snape, sending the two of them down in
//a heap.

// 18167
//Professor Snape picked himself up and resumed standing in front of the door.
//His head tracked to look at Harry. “I am guarding this door at the Headmaster’s
//orders,” said Professor Snape in his usual sardonic tones. “Be off with you at
//once, or I shall deduct House Points.”

// 18168
//This was bone-chillingly creepy, but Harry’s attention was occupied by the
//gigantic three-headed dog which had lunged forward, only to be stopped meters
//from Harry by the chains upon its three collars.

// 18169
//“That - that - that - ” Harry said.

// 18170
//“Yes,” Professor Quirrell said from a ways behind him, “that is indeed the
//usual occupant of that chamber, which is off-limits to all students, especially
//first-years.”

// 18171
//__“That’s not safe even by wizard standards!”__ Within the chamber, the
//enormous black beast gave a multi-voiced bellow, flecks of white saliva flying
//from three fanged mouths.

// 18172
//Professor Quirrell sighed. “It is enchanted not to eat students, just spit them
//back out through the door. Now, boy, how would you recommend that we deal with
//this dangerous creature?”

// 18173
//“Uh,” Harry stuttered, trying to think over the continued roaring of the
//chamber’s guardian. “Uh. If it’s like the Cerberus from the Muggle legend of
//Orpheus and Eurydice, then we have to sing it to sleep so we can pass -”

// 18174
//“__Avada Kedavra.__”

// 18175
//The three-headed beast fell over.

// 18176
//Harry looked back at Professor Quirrell, who was giving him a look of extreme
//disappointment, as if to ask whether Harry had attended any of his classes,
//ever.

// 18177
//“I sort of __assumed__,” Harry said, still trying to catch his breath,
//“that going through this challenge in any way except the one used by
//first-years, might perhaps trigger an __alarm__.”

// 18178
//“That is a lie, boy, you simply did not remember your lessons when you faced
//the occasion in true life. As for alarms, I have spent months befuddling all
//the wards and tripsigns upon these chambers.”

// 18179
//“Then why did you send me in first, exactly?”

// 18180
//Professor Quirrell just smiled. It looked significantly more evil than usual.

// 18181
//“Never mind,” Harry said, and walked slowly into the chamber, his limbs still
//shaking.

// 18182
//The chamber was all of stone, illuminated by a pale blue light that shone from
//arched nooks carved into the wall; as if the light of a grey sky were passing
//through windows, though there were no windows. At the far end of the chamber
//was a wooden trapdoor upon the floor, with a single ring attached. In the
//middle of the chamber lay a gigantic dead dog with three lifeless heads.

// 18183
//Harry turned toward one of the arched nooks and looked inside it. There was
//nothing there but the sourceless blue glow, so he walked over and looked in the
//next one, also scrutinizing the wall as he passed.

// 18184
//“What,” said Professor Quirrell, “are you doing?”

// 18185
//“Searching the room,” Harry said. “There could be a clue, or an inscription, or
//a key we’ll need later, or something -”

// 18186
//“Are you serious, or are you deliberately trying to slow us down? Answer in
//Parseltongue.”

// 18187
//Harry looked back. “__Wass sseriouss,__” hissed Harry. ”__Would have
//done ssame if came by mysself.__”

// 18188
//Professor Quirrell briefly massaged his forehead. “I confess,” he said, “that
//your approach would serve you well in, say, exploring the tomb of Amon-Set, so
//I will not quite call you an idiot, but still. The false puzzle, the outer form
//of the challenge, is a game meant for first-years. We simply go down through
//the trapdoor.”

// 18189
//Beneath the trapdoor was a gigantic plant, something like an enormous
//dieffenbachia with wide leaves emerging from the central stem like a spiral
//staircase, but darker-colored than a normal dieffenbachia, with tendril-like
//vines emerging from the central stem and hanging down. The base spread out wide
//with bigger leaves and tendrils, as though promising to cushion anyone’s fall.
//Beneath was another stone chamber like the first, with the same nooks like
//false arched windows, emitting the same grey-blue light.

// 18190
//“The obvious thought is to fly down on the broomstick in my pouch, or toss
//something heavy to see if those tendrils are traps,” Harry said, peering down.
//“But I’m guessing you’ll say that we just walk down the leaves.” They certainly
//looked like they were meant to be a spiral staircase.

// 18191
//“After you,” said Professor Quirrell.

// 18192
//Harry carefully put a foot down on a leaf and found that it indeed supported
//his weight. Then Harry took a last look around the room before departing, to
//see if there was anything worth noticing.

// 18193
//The enormous dead dog called enough attention to itself that it was hard to
//focus on anything else.

// 18194
//“Professor Quirrell,” Harry said, omitting the phrase __your approach to
//dealing with obstacles has certain drawbacks,__ “what if somebody looks in the
//door and sees that the Cerberus is dead?”

// 18195
//“Then they have probably already noticed something wrong with Snape,” said
//Professor Quirrell. “But since you insist…” The Defense Professor walked over
//to the three-headed corpse and placed his wand against it. He began a
//Latin-sounding incantation that was accompanied by a sense of rising
//apprehension, the Boy-Who-Lived feeling the Dark Lord’s power as he always had.

// 18196
//The last word spoken was __“Inferius”__ and it was accompanied by a final
//surge of __STOP, DON’T__.

// 18197
//And the three-headed dog rose to a stand, its six eyes dull and blank, turning
//to watch the door once more.

// 18198
//Harry stared at the huge Inferius with a horrible sinking sensation in his
//stomach, the third-worst feeling he’d ever felt in his life.

// 18199
//He knew then that he’d seen and sensed this procedure before, only without the
//spoken Latin.

// 18200
//The centaur who’d confronted him in the Forbidden Forest was dead. The Defense
//Professor had hit it with a real Avada Kedavra, not a fake one.

// 18201
//Somewhere in the back of his mind, Harry had thought that if he could just get
//Hermione __back__ then he could return to the code of nobody dying, the
//ethic of Batman. Most people went through their whole lives without anyone
//getting killed on whatever adventures they had.

// 18202
//And that was not to be.

// 18203
//He hadn’t even noticed, the day he lost his last chance to win. Even if
//Hermione was resurrected, now, Harry wouldn’t have come through the whole mess
//without anyone getting killed.

// 18204
//He hadn’t even learned the centaur’s name.

// 18205
//Harry said nothing aloud. The Defense Professor would either confirm the
//accusation in Parseltongue or lie in plain speech, and either way the Defense
//Professor would have more reason to suspect Harry’s next actions. But Harry
//knew that - although he didn’t know __how__ he would stop Professor
//Quirrell, although he didn’t dare any positive act of betrayal, maybe not even
//making the __decision,__ until it was almost time to win - there would
//never be an amicable settlement between him and Lord Voldemort, for those two
//different spirits could not exist in the same world.

// 18206
//And it was like that resolution, that knowledge of opposition, invoked a
//strength from what Harry had thought of as his dark side. Harry had stopped
//trying to call deliberately on his dark side after the day he’d killed the
//troll. But his dark side had never been something separate from him. It had
//been something remembered from Tom Riddle. Harry didn’t know how that had
//happened, but taking the assumption and running with it, whatever echoes of
//cognitive skill were in his dark side should be there for him to use. Not as a
//separate mode, as Harry had conceptualized at first, but just as neural
//patterns with a strong tendency to chain into one another since they had once
//formed part of a connected whole.

// 18207
//This unfortunately did not change that Professor Quirrell had the same skills
//with far more life experience backing them up, and also had the gun.

// 18208
//Harry turned, and set foot on the giant plant, and began to walk down the
//spiral staircase provided by the leaves. It had taken Harry too long this time,
//but he’d recovered himself to some degree, despite the grief still weighing him
//down like thick water. It wasn’t a cold steel rod in his spine, but it was
//something straight and solid nonetheless. He was going to play this through,
//see Hermione returned to life first, and then, somehow, stop Professor
//Quirrell. Or stop Professor Quirrell first and then get the Stone himself.
//There had to be something, some possibility, some opportunity that would
//present itself, some way to stop Voldemort __and__ return Hermione to
//life…

// 18209
//Harry continued his descent.

// 18210
//Behind him, the three-headed dog waited, guarding the gate.
