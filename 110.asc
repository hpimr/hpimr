// 18685
//== Reflections, Pt 2

// 18686
//The grimness on Albus Dumbledore’s face lasted only an instant before giving
//way to bewilderment. “Quirinus? What -”

// 18687
//And then there was a pause.

// 18688
//“Well,” said Albus Dumbledore. “I do feel stupid.”

// 18689
//“I should hope so,” Professor Quirrell said easily; if he had been at all
//shocked himself at being caught, it did not show. A casual wave of his hand
//changed his robes back to a Professor’s clothing.

// 18690
//Dumbledore’s grimness had returned and redoubled. “There I am, searching so
//hard for Voldemort’s shade, never noticing that the Defense Professor of
//Hogwarts is a sickly, half-dead victim possessed by a spirit far more powerful
//than himself. I would call it senility, if so many others had not missed it as
//well.”

// 18691
//“Quite,” said Professor Quirrell. He lifted his eyebrows. “Really, am I that
//hard to recognise without the glowing red eyes?”

// 18692
//“Oh, yes indeed,” Albus Dumbledore said in level tones. “Your acting was
//perfect; I confess myself utterly deceived. Quirinus Quirrell seemed - what is
//the term I am looking for? Ah yes, that is the word. He seemed sane.”

// 18693
//Professor Quirrell chuckled; he looked for all the world as though the two of
//them were just having a casual conversation. “I never was insane, you know.
//Lord Voldemort was just another game for me, the same as Professor Quirrell.”

// 18694
//Albus Dumbledore did not look like he was enjoying a casual chat. “I thought
//you might say that. I regret to inform you, Tom, that anyone who can bring
//himself to act the part of Voldemort __is__ Voldemort.”

// 18695
//“Ah,” said Professor Quirrell, raising an admonishing finger. “There is a
//loophole in that reasoning, old man. Anyone who acts the part of Voldemort must
//be what moralists call ‘evil’, on this we agree. But perhaps the real me is
//completely, utterly, irredeemably evil in an interestingly different fashion
//from what I was pretending with Voldemort -”

// 18696
//“I find,” Albus Dumbledore ground out, “that I do not care.”

// 18697
//“Then you must think yourself to be rid of me very soon,” said Professor
//Quirrell. “How interesting. My immortal existence must depend on discovering
//what trap you have set, and finding a way to escape from it, as soon as
//possible.” Professor Quirrell paused. “But let us pointlessly delay to talk of
//other matters first. How did you come to be waiting inside the Mirror? I
//thought you would be elsewhere.”

// 18698
//“I am there,” Albus Dumbledore said, “and __also__ inside the Mirror,
//unfortunately for you. I have always been here, all along.”

// 18699
//“Ah,” said Professor Quirrell, and sighed. “I suppose my little distraction was
//for naught, then.”

// 18700
//And the rage of Albus Dumbledore was no longer leashed. “__Distraction?__”
//roared Dumbledore, his sapphire eyes tight with fury. ”__You killed
//Master Flamel for a distraction?__”

// 18701
//Professor Quirrell looked dismayed. “I am wounded by the injustice of your
//accusation. I did not kill the one you know as Flamel. I simply commanded
//another to do so.”

// 18702
//“__How could you? Even you, how could you? He was the library of all our
//lore! Secrets you have forever lost to wizardry!__”

// 18703
//There was an edge to Professor Quirrell’s smile, now. “You know, I still do not
//comprehend how your twisted mind can consider it acceptable for Flamel to be
//immortal, but when I try for the same it makes me a monster.”

// 18704
//“Master Flamel never descended into __immortality!__ He -” Dumbledore
//choked. “He only stayed awake past his evening, for our sakes, through his
//long, long day -”

// 18705
//“I don’t know if you recall this,” Professor Quirrell said, his voice airy,
//“but do you recall that day in your office with Tom Riddle? The one where I
//begged you, where I went down on my knees and begged you, to introduce me to
//Nicholas Flamel so that I could ask to become his apprentice, to someday make
//for myself the Philosopher’s Stone? That was my last attempt to be a good
//person, if you are curious. You told me no, and gave me a lecture on how
//unvirtuous it was to be afraid of death. I went from your office in bitterness
//and in fury. I reasoned that if I was to be called evil in any case, just for
//not wanting to die, then I might as well be evil; and one month later I killed
//Abigail Myrtle to pursue immortality by other means. Even when I knew more of
//Flamel, I remained quite put out with your hypocrisy; and for that reason I
//tormented you and yours more than I otherwise would have done. I have often
//felt that you ought to know this, but we never had a chance to talk frankly.”

// 18706
//“I decline,” said Albus Dumbledore, whose gaze did not waver. “I do not accept
//the tiniest shred of responsibility for what you have become. That was all,
//entirely, you and your own decisions.”

// 18707
//“I am not surprised to hear you say that,” said Professor Quirrell. “Well, now
//I am curious as to what responsibilities you do accept. You have access to some
//unusual power of Divination; that much I deduced long ago. You made too many
//nonsensical moves, and the paths by which they worked out in your favor were
//too ridiculous. So tell me. Were you forewarned of the result, that night of
//All Hallow’s Eve when I was vanquished for a time?”

// 18708
//“I knew,” said Albus Dumbledore, his voice low and cold. “For that, I accept
//responsibility, which is something you will never understand.”

// 18709
//“You arranged for Severus Snape to hear the Prophecy that he brought to me.”

// 18710
//“I allowed it to happen,” said Albus Dumbledore.

// 18711
//“And there I was, all excited at having finally gained my own foreknowledge.”
//Professor Quirrell shook his head as though in sadness. “So the great hero
//Dumbledore sacrificed his unwitting pawns, Lily and James Potter, merely to
//banish me for a few years.”

// 18712
//Albus Dumbledore’s eyes were like stones. “James and Lily would have gone
//willingly to the death, if they had known.”

// 18713
//“And the little baby?” Professor Quirrell said. “Somehow I doubt the Potters
//would have been so eager to leave him in the path of You-Know-Who.”

// 18714
//You could scarcely see the flinch. “The Boy-Who-Lived came out of it well
//enough. Tried to turn him into __you__, did you? Instead you turned
//yourself into a corpse, and Harry Potter became the wizard you should have
//been.” Now there was something like the usual Dumbledore behind the half-moon
//glasses, a tiny twinkle in those eyes. “All of Tom Riddle’s icy brilliance,
//tamed to the service of James and Lily’s warmth and love. I wonder how you felt
//when you saw what Tom Riddle could have become, if he had grown up in a loving
//family?”

// 18715
//Professor Quirrell’s lips quirked. “I was surprised, even shocked, by the
//abyssal depths of Mr. Potter’s naivete.”

// 18716
//“I suppose the humor of the situation would be lost on you.” It was then,
//finally, that Albus Dumbledore smiled. “How I laughed when I realised it! When
//I saw you had made a Good Voldemort to oppose the evil one - ah, how I laughed!
//I never had the steel for my role, but Harry Potter shall be more than equal to
//it, when he comes into his power.” Albus Dumbledore’s smile disappeared.
//“Though I suppose Harry shall have to find some other Dark Lord to vanquish for
//it, since you will not be there.”

// 18717
//“Ah, yes. That.” Professor Quirrell made to walk away from the Mirrror, and
//seemed to halt just before reaching the point where the Mirror would no longer
//have reflected him, if it had been reflecting him. “Interesting.”

// 18718
//Dumbledore’s smile was colder, now. “No, Tom. You are not going anywhere.”

// 18719
//Professor Quirrell nodded. “What have you done, exactly?”

// 18720
//“You have refused death,” said Dumbledore, “and if I destroyed your body, your
//spirit would only wander back, like a dumb animal that cannot understand it is
//being sent away. So I am sending you outside Time, to a frozen instant from
//which neither I nor any other can return you. Perhaps Harry Potter will be able
//to retrieve you someday, if prophecy speaks true. He may wish to discuss with
//you just who is at fault for the deaths of his parents. For you it will only be
//an instant - if you ever return at all. Either way, Tom, I wish you the best of
//it.”

// 18721
//“Hm,” said Professor Quirrell. The Defense Professor had paced past where Harry
//stood, watching mute and with something like horror, only to halt again at the
//other edge of the mirror. “As I suspected. You are using Merlin’s old method of
//sealing, what the tale of Topherius Chang names as the Process of the Timeless.
//If legend speaks true, not even you can stop the process, now that it has been
//in motion this long.”

// 18722
//“Indeed,” said Albus Dumbledore. But his eyes were suddenly wary.

// 18723
//And Harry, from where he stood just before and to the right of the door,
//waiting in silence and controlled terror, could feel it in the air; he could
//feel the sense of a __presence__ gathering within the Mirror’s field.
//Something more alien than magic, everything about it incomprehensible except
//for the fact of its strangeness and the fact of its power. It had been slow but
//now it was waxing faster, that presence.

// 18724
//“But you could still reverse the effect, if Chang’s account is true,” said
//Professor Quirrell. “Most powers of the Mirror are double-sided, according to
//legend. So you could banish what is on the other side of the Mirror instead.
//Send yourself, instead of me, into that frozen instant. If you wanted to, that
//is.”

// 18725
//“And why would I do that?” Albus Dumbledore’s voice was tight. “I suppose you
//are going to tell me that you have taken hostages? That was futile, Tom, you
//__fool!__ You utter __fool!__ You should have known that I would give
//you nothing for any hostages you had taken.”

// 18726
//“You always were one step too slow,” said Professor Quirrell. “Allow me to
//introduce you to my hostage.”

// 18727
//Another presence invaded the air around Harry, a crawling sensation all over
//his flesh as another Tom Riddle’s magic passed very close to his skin. The
//Cloak of Invisibility was torn away from him, and the shimmering black Cloak
//flew away from him, through the air.

// 18728
//Professor Quirrell caught it, and swiftly drew it over himself; in less than a
//second he had pulled down the Cloak’s hood over his head, and disappeared.

// 18729
//Albus Dumbledore staggered, as though some essential support had been removed
//from him.

// 18730
//“Harry Potter,” the Headmaster breathed. “__What are you doing here?__”

// 18731
//Harry stared at the image of Albus Dumbledore, on whose face utter shock and
//utter dismay were warring.

// 18732
//The guilt and the shame were too much, too much, hitting Harry all at once, and
//he could feel the incomprehensible presence around him rising to a peak. Harry
//knew without words that there was no time left, and that he was done.

// 18733
//“It’s my fault,” Harry said in a tiny voice, from whatever part of him had
//taken over his throat in the final extremity. “I was stupid. I’ve always been
//stupid. You mustn’t rescue me. Goodbye.”

// 18734
//“Why, look at that,” sang out Professor Quirrell’s voice from the empty air, “I
//don’t seem to have a reflection any more.”

// 18735
//“No,” said Albus Dumbledore. “No, no, __NO!__”

// 18736
//Into the hand of the Albus Dumbledore flew from his sleeve his long, dark-grey
//wand, and in his other hand, as though from nowhere, appeared a short rod of
//dark stone.

// 18737
//Albus Dumbledore threw these both violently aside, just as the building sense
//of power rose to an unbearable peak, and then disappeared.

// 18738
//The Mirror returned to showing the ordinary reflection of a gold-lit room of
//white stone, without any trace of where Albus Dumbledore had been.

// 18739
