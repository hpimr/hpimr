// 15771
//__Thursday, April 16th, 1992.__

// 15772
//The school was almost deserted now, nine-tenths of the students having gone
//home for the Easter holiday, just about everyone she knew missing. Susan had
//stayed behind, her grand-aunt being quite busy, as had Ron for reasons she
//didn’t know - maybe the Weasley family was poor enough that feeding all the
//children for an extra week would’ve been a noticeable strain? It all worked out
//well enough, since Ron and Susan were just about the only ones left who’d still
//talk to her. (At least that she wanted to talk back __to. __Lavender was
//still nice to her, and Tracey was, um, Tracey, but neither of them were quite
//__relaxing__ to spend a free hour around; and in any case, neither of
//those two had stayed over for the Easter hols.)

// 15773
//If she couldn’t go __home__ - and she wasn’t allowed to go home, her
//parents had been lied-to and told she’d had Glowpox - then an almost-empty
//Hogwarts was the next best thing.

// 15774
//She could even visit the library without people staring at her, since there
//were no lessons and nobody was trying to do schoolwork.

// 15775
//It would be a mistake to think that Hermione drooped about the corridors
//weeping all day long. Oh, she’d cried a lot the first two days, of course, but
//two days had been enough. There were parts of Harry’s borrowed books about
//that, how even people who were paralyzed in car accidents weren’t nearly as
//unhappy as they’d expected to be, six months later, just like lottery winners
//weren’t nearly as happy as they’d expected. People adjusted, their happiness
//levels went back to their happiness set point, life went on.

// 15776
//A shadow fell over where Hermione was reading her current book and she whirled
//around, the wand hidden on her lap coming up to point directly at the surprised
//face of -

// 15777
//“Sorry!” Harry Potter said, hastily holding up his palms to show his left hand
//empty, and his right hand holding a small red-velvet pouch. “Sorry. Didn’t mean
//to startle you.”

// 15778
//There was an awful silence, her heartbeat increasing and her palms starting to
//sweat as Harry Potter just looked at her. She’d __almost__ talked to him,
//on the first morning of the rest of her life; but when she’d come down to
//breakfast Harry Potter had looked so __awful__ - so she hadn’t sat down
//beside him at the breakfast-table, just quietly eaten in her own little bubble
//of nobody else sitting next to her, and it had been horrible, but Harry hadn’t
//come to her, and… she just hadn’t talked to him, since then. (It wasn’t hard to
//avoid everyone, if you stayed out of the Ravenclaw common room, and ran out of
//classes before anyone could talk to you.)

// 15779
//And ever since she’d been wondering what Harry thought of her now - if he hated
//her for having lost all his money - or if he really__ was__ in love with
//her and that’s why he’d done it - or if he’d given up on her keeping pace with
//him because __she__ couldn’t __frighten Dementors__ - she couldn’t
//face him now, she just couldn’t, she spent sleepless nights worrying what Harry
//thought of her now, and she was afraid, and she’d been avoiding the boy who’d
//spent all his money to save her, and she was a horrible ungrateful wretch, and
//a terrible person and -

// 15780
//Then her eyes glanced down to see that Harry was reaching into the red-velvet
//pouch and taking out a heart-shaped red-foil-wrapped sweet, and her brain
//melted down like chocolate left out in the sun.

// 15781
//“I was going to give you more space,” said Harry Potter, “only I was reading up
//on Critch’s theories about hedonics and how to train your inner pigeon and how
//small immediate positive and negative feedbacks secretly control most of what
//we actually do, and it occurred to me that you might be avoiding me because
//seeing me made you think of things that felt like negative associations, and I
//really __didn’t__ want to let that run any longer without doing something
//about it, so I got ahold of a bag of chocolates from the Weasley twins and I’m
//just going to give you one every time you see me as a positive reinforcement if
//that’s all right with you -”

// 15782
//“__Breathe__, Harry,” Hermione said without thinking about it.

// 15783
//It was the first word she’d spoken to him since the day of the trial.

// 15784
//The two of them stared at each other.

// 15785
//The books stared at them from the surrounding shelves.

// 15786
//They stared some more at each other.

// 15787
//“You’re supposed to eat the chocolate,” Harry said, holding out the
//heart-shaped sweet like a Valentine. “Unless just being given a chocolate feels
//good enough to count as a positive reinforcement, in which case you probably
//need to put it in your pocket or something.”

// 15788
//She knew that if she tried speaking again she’d fail, so she didn’t try.

// 15789
//Harry’s head slumped a bit. “__Do__ you hate me now?”

// 15790
//“__No!__” she said. “No, you shouldn’t think that, Harry! Just - just -
//just __everything!__” She realized that her wand was still pointed at
//Harry, and she lowered it. She was trying very hard not to burst out into
//tears. ”__Everything!__” she repeated, and couldn’t find any better to say
//than that, although she was certain that Harry wanted to tell her to be
//specific.

// 15791
//“I think I understand,” Harry said cautiously. “What’re you reading?”

// 15792
//Before she could stop him, them, Harry bent over the library-desk to see the
//book she was reading, leaning his head forward before she could think to grab
//the book away -

// 15793
//Harry stared at the open page.

// 15794
//“The World’s Wealthiest Wizards and How They Got That Way,” Harry read off the
//book’s title from the top. “Number sixty-five, Sir Gareth, owner of a
//transportation company that won the 19th-century shipping wars… monopoly on
//oh-tee-threes… I see.”

// 15795
//“I s’pose you’re going to tell me that I don’t need to worry about anything and
//you’ll take care of it all?” It came out sounding harsher than she would’ve
//wanted, and she felt another stab of guilt for being such a terrible person.

// 15796
//“Nah,” Harry said, sounding oddly cheerful. “I can put myself in your shoes
//well enough to know that if __you__ paid a bunch of money to save
//__me, I’d__ be trying to pay it back. I’d know it was silly on some level,
//and I’d __still__ be trying to pay it back all by myself. There’s no way I
//wouldn’t understand __that__, Hermione.”

// 15797
//Hermione’s face screwed up and she felt moisture in the corners of her eyes.

// 15798
//“Fair warning, though,” Harry went on, “I might solve the debt to Lucius Malfoy
//myself if I see a way before you do, it’s more important to get that sorted
//immediately than __which__ one of us gets it sorted. Anything interesting
//so far?”

// 15799
//Three-quarters of her was running in circles and smashing into trees as she
//tried to figure out the implications of everything Harry had just said
//(__did__ he still respect her as a heroine? or did that mean he thought
//she __couldn’t__ do it on her own?) and meanwhile a much more sensible
//part of Hermione flipped back the book to page 37 which had the most promising
//entry she’d seen so far (though in her imagination she always did it on her own
//and took Harry completely by surprise) -

// 15800
//“I thought this seemed quite interesting,” her voice said.

// 15801
//“Number fourteen, ‘Crozier’, true name unknown,” Harry read. “Wow, that is…
//that is the gaudiest checkered top hat I’ve ever seen. Wealth, at least six
//hundred thousand Galleons… so around thirty million pounds, not enough to make
//a Muggle famous, but good enough for the smaller wizard population, I guess.
//Rumored to be a modern alias of the six-century-old Nicholas Flamel, the only
//known wizard to succeed at the incredibly difficult alchemical procedure for
//creating the Philosopher’s Stone, which enables the transmutation of base
//metals into gold or silver as well as… the Elixir of Life which indefinitely
//prolongs the youth and health of the user… Um, Hermione, this seems obviously
//false.”

// 15802
//“I’ve read more references to Nicholas Flamel,” Hermione said. “__The
//Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts__ says he secretly trained Dumbledore to stand up
//to Grindelwald. There’s a lot of books that take the story seriously, not just
//this one… you think it’s too good to be true?”

// 15803
//“No, of course not,” said Harry. Harry pulled out the chair next to her own, at
//the small table, and sat down beside her in his accustomed place on her right,
//just like he’d never left; she had to choke back a catch in her throat. “The
//idea of ‘too good to be true’ isn’t causal reasoning, the universe doesn’t
//check if the output of the equations is ‘too good’ or ‘too bad’ before allowing
//it. People used to think that airplanes and smallpox vaccines were too good to
//be true. Muggles have figured out ways to travel to other stars without even
//using magic, and you and I can use our wands to do things that Muggle
//physicists think are literally impossible. I can’t even imagine what we could
//rule out the __real__ laws of magic being able to do.”

// 15804
//“So what’s the problem, then?” Hermione said. Her voice sounded more normal
//now, in her own ears.

// 15805
//“Well…” Harry said. The boy reached over her own outstretched arm, his robes
//brushing hers, and tapped the artist’s illustration of an ominously glowing red
//stone dripping scarlet liquid. “Problem one is that there’s no logical reason
//why the __same__ artifact would be able to transmute lead to gold
//__and__ produce an elixir that kept someone young. I wonder if there’s an
//official name for that in the literature? Like the ‘turned up to eleven
//effect’, maybe? If everyone can see a flower, you can’t get away with saying
//flowers are the size of houses. But if you’re in a flying saucer cult, since
//nobody can see the alien mothership anyway, you can say it’s the size of a
//city, or the size of the Moon. Observable things have to be constrained by
//evidence, but when somebody makes up a story, they can make the story as
//extreme as they want. So the Philosopher’s Stone gives you unlimited gold
//__and__ eternal life, not because there’s a single magical discovery that
//would produce both of those effects, but because someone made up a story about
//a super happy thingy.”

// 15806
//“Harry, there’s a lot of things in magic that aren’t sensible,” she said.

// 15807
//“Granted,” said Harry. “But Hermione, problem two is that not even
//__wizards__ are crazy enough to casually overlook the implications of
//__this__. __Everyone __would be trying to rediscover the formula for
//the Philosopher’s Stone, whole __countries__ would be trying to capture
//the immortal wizard and get the secret out of him -”

// 15808
//“It’s not a __secret.__” Hermione flipped the page, showing Harry the
//diagrams. “The instructions are right on the next page. It’s just so difficult
//that only Nicholas Flamel’s __done__ it.”

// 15809
//“So entire countries would be trying to kidnap Flamel and force __him__ to
//make more Stones. Come on, Hermione, even wizards wouldn’t hear about
//__immortality__ and, and,” Harry Potter paused, his eloquence apparently
//failing him, “and __just keep going.__ Humans are crazy, but they’re not
//__that__ crazy!”

// 15810
//“Not everyone thinks the same way __you__ do, Harry.” He did have a point,
//but… __how__ many different references had she come across to Nicholas
//Flamel? Besides __World’s Wealthiest Wizards__ and __Rise and Fall
//of the Dark Arts,__ there’d also been __Stories of Moderately Ancient
//Times__ and __Biographies of the Justly Famous…__

// 15811
//“All right then, __Professor Quirrell__ would’ve kidnapped this Flamel
//guy. It’s what an evil person __or__ a good person or just a
//__selfish__ person would do if they had any sense. The Defense Professor
//knows a lot of secrets and he wouldn’t miss __that__ one.” Harry sighed
//and looked up; she followed his gaze, but he was apparently just looking at the
//larger library, the rows and rows and rows of bookcases. “I don’t mean to mess
//with your project,” said Harry, “and I certainly don’t mean to discourage you,
//but… Honestly, Hermione, I’m not sure you’re going to find any good ideas for
//making money in a book like this. Like the old joke about how if an economist
//sees a twenty-pound note lying in the street, they won’t bother picking it up,
//because if it were real, someone else would’ve picked it up already. Any way of
//making lots of money that everyone __knows__ about to the point where it’s
//in books like this… you see what I’m saying? It can’t be possible for everyone
//to make a thousand Galleons a month in three easy steps, or everyone would be
//doing it.”

// 15812
//“So? That wouldn’t stop __you,__” Hermione said, her voice now roughening
//again. “You do impossible things all the time, I bet you’ve done something
//impossible in the last __week__ and you didn’t bother __telling__
//anyone.”

// 15813
//(There was a slight pause, which, if Miss Granger had known, was exactly the
//length of pause you’d make if you’d fought Mad-Eye Moody and won exactly eight
//days earlier.)

// 15814
//“Not in the last seven days, no,” Harry said. “Look… part of the trick of doing
//the impossible is being selective about __which__ impossibilities you
//challenge, and only trying when you have a special advantage. If there’s a
//money-making method in this book that sounds difficult for a wizard, but it’s
//easy if we can use Dad’s old Mac Plus, __then__ we’d have a plan.”

// 15815
//“I __know that,__ Harry,” Hermione said, her voice wavering only slightly.
//“I was looking to see if there was anything here I __could__ figure out
//how to do. I thought, maybe the difficult part about making a Philosopher’s
//Stone was that the alchemical circle had to be super precise, and I could get
//it right by using a Muggle microscope -”

// 15816
//“That’s __brilliant,__ Hermione!” The boy rapidly drew his wand, said
//“__Quietus,__” and then continued after the small noises of the rowdier
//books had died down. “Even if the Philosopher’s Stone is just a myth, the same
//trick might work for other difficult alchemies -”

// 15817
//“Well, it __can’t__ work,” Hermione said. She’d flown across the library
//to look up the only book on alchemy that wasn’t in the Restricted Section. And
//then - she remembered the crushing letdown, all the sudden hope dissipating
//like mist. “Because __all__ alchemical circles have to be drawn ‘to the
//fineness of a child’s hair’, it isn’t any finer for some alchemies than others.
//And wizards __have__ Omnioculars, and I haven’t heard of any spells where
//you use Omnioculars to magnify things and do them exactly. I should’ve realized
//that!”

// 15818
//“Hermione,” Harry said seriously, as he started to dig down into the red-velvet
//pouch again, “don’t punish yourself when a bright idea doesn’t work out. You’ve
//got to go through a __lot__ of flawed ideas to find one that might work.
//And if you send your brain negative feedback by frowning when you think of a
//flawed idea, instead of realizing that idea-suggesting is good behavior by your
//brain to be encouraged, pretty soon you won’t think of any ideas at all.” Harry
//put down two heart-shaped chocolates beside the book. “Here, have another
//chocolate. Besides the one from earlier, I mean. This one is to reinforce your
//brain for generating a good candidate strategy.”

// 15819
//“I suppose you’re right,” Hermione said in a small voice, but she didn’t touch
//the chocolate. She started to turn the pages back to 167, where she’d been
//reading before Harry had come in.

// 15820
//(Hermione Granger did not require __bookmarks, __of course.)

// 15821
//Harry was leaning over slightly, his head almost touching her shoulder,
//watching the pages as she turned them, as though he might be able to glean
//valuable information from glimpsing the page for only a quarter-second.
//Breakfast hadn’t been long ago, and she could clearly identify, from the faint
//scent of his breath, that Harry’d eaten banana pudding for dessert.

// 15822
//Harry spoke again. “So with all that said… and please take this as a positive
//reinforcement… did you really try to invent a way to __mass-produce
//immortality__ so that I could __pay off my debt to Lucius Malfoy?__”

// 15823
//“Yes,” she said in an even smaller voice. Even when she __tried__ to think
//like Harry, it seemed she hadn’t yet got the knack of it. “So what’ve you been
//doing this whole time, Harry?”

// 15824
//Harry made a disgusted face. “Trying to collect evidence on the whole ‘Who
//Framed Hermione Granger’ mystery.”

// 15825
//“I…” Hermione looked up at Harry. “Shouldn’t I… be trying to solve my
//__own__ mystery, though?” It hadn’t been her first thought, her first
//priority, but now that Harry mentioned it…

// 15826
//“That wouldn’t work in this case,” Harry said soberly. “There’s too many people
//who’ll talk to me and not you… and I’m also sorry to say that some of them made
//me promise not to talk to anyone else. Sorry, I don’t think you can help much
//on this one.”

// 15827
//“Okay, I guess,” Hermione said leadenly. “Fine. You do everything. You gather
//all the clues and talk to all the suspects while I just sit here in the
//library. Let me know after it turns out that it was Professor Quirrell who did
//it.”

// 15828
//“Hermione…” Harry said. “Why is it so important __who__ does what?
//Shouldn’t it be more important to get everything solved, than who solves it?”

// 15829
//“I guess you’re right,” Hermione said. She lifted her hands to press up at her
//eyes. “I guess it doesn’t matter any more. Everyone’s going to think - I
//__know__ it’s not your fault, Harry, you were - you were being Good, you
//were a perfect gentleman - but no matter what I do now, they’ll all think that
//I’m just - someone for you to rescue.” She paused, and said, with her voice
//quivering, “And maybe they’re __right__, Harry.”

// 15830
//“Whoa, whoa, hold on there a second -”

// 15831
//“I can’t scare Dementors. I can get Outstandings in Charms class, but I can’t
//scare Dementors.”

// 15832
//“__I’ve got a mysterious dark side!__” Harry hissed, after his head turned
//around to scan the library. (There was one boy in a distant corner, who did
//look in their direction occasionally, but he would’ve been too far away to hear
//anything even without the Quieting Barrier.) “I’ve got a dark side that
//__definitely__ isn’t a child, and who knows what other crazy magical stuff
//going on in my head - Professor Quirrell claimed that I become whoever I
//believe I am - that’s all __cheating,__ don’t you see, Hermione? There’s
//an arrangement that the school administration made that I’m not supposed to
//talk about, so that the Boy-Who-Lived could have more time to study every day,
//I’m __cheating__ and you’re __still beating me in Charms class. __I’m
//- I’m probably not - the Boy-Who-Lived probably isn’t even something that you
//could properly call a child - and you’re __still competing__ with that.
//Don’t you realize, if it __wasn’t__ for people paying attention to me,
//you’d look like the most powerful witch to come along in a century? When you
//can fight three older bullies by yourself, and win?”

// 15833
//“I don’t know,” she said, pressing her hands again over her eyes, with her
//voice wavering. “All I know is - even if that’s all __true__ - nobody’s
//ever going to see me for myself anymore, ever.”

// 15834
//“All right,” Harry said after a while. “I see what you mean. Instead of the
//famous Potter-and-Granger research team, there’ll be Harry Potter and his lab
//assistant. Um… here’s an idea. How about if I __don’t__ focus on making
//money for a while? I mean, the debt doesn’t come due until I graduate Hogwarts.
//So you can do it yourself and show the world you’ve still got it. And if you
//coincidentally crack the secret of immortality along the way, we’ll just call
//it a bonus.”

// 15835
//The thought of Harry relying on __her__ to come up with a solution seemed…
//like a crushing burden of responsibility to dump on a poor traumatized
//twelve-year-old girl, and she wanted to hug him for offering her a way to
//restore her self-respect as a heroine, and it was what she __deserved__
//for being a horrible person and speaking sharply to Harry all the time, when
//all along he’d been a truer friend to her than she’d ever been to him, and it
//was good that he still thought she could do things, and…

// 15836
//“Is there some amazing rational thing you do when your mind’s running in all
//different directions?” she managed.

// 15837
//“My own approach is usually to identify the different desires, give them names,
//conceive of them as separate individuals, and let them argue it out inside my
//head. So far the main persistent ones are my Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Gryffindor,
//and Slytherin sides, my Inner Critic, and my simulated copies of you, Neville,
//Draco, Professor McGonagall, Professor Flitwick, Professor Quirrell, Dad, Mum,
//Richard Feynman, and Douglas Hofstadter.”

// 15838
//Hermione considered trying this before her Common Sense warned that it might be
//a dangerous sort of thing to pretend. “There’s a copy of __me__ inside
//your head?”

// 15839
//“Of course there is!” Harry said. The boy suddenly looked a bit more
//vulnerable. “You mean there __isn’t__ a copy of me living in __your
//__head?”

// 15840
//There __was,__ she realized; and not only that, it talked in Harry’s exact
//voice.

// 15841
//“It’s rather unnerving now that I think about it,” said Hermione. “I do have a
//copy of you living in my head. It’s talking to me right now using your voice,
//arguing how this is perfectly normal.”

// 15842
//“Good,” Harry said seriously. “I mean, I don’t see how people could be friends
//without that.”

// 15843
//She continued reading her book, then, Harry seeming content to watch the pages
//over her shoulder.

// 15844
//She’d gotten all the way to number seventy, Katherine Scott, who’d apparently
//invented a way to turn small animals into lemon tarts, when she finally worked
//up the courage to speak.

// 15845
//“Harry?” she said. (She was leaning a bit away from him now, though she didn’t
//realize it.) “If there’s a copy of Draco Malfoy in your head, does that mean
//you’re friends with Draco Malfoy?”

// 15846
//“Well…” Harry said. He sighed. “Yeah, I’d been meaning to talk with you about
//this anyway. I kind of wish I’d talked to you sooner. Anyway, how can I put
//this… I was corrupting him?”

// 15847
//“What do you mean __corrupting?__”

// 15848
//“Tempting him to the Light Side of the Force.”

// 15849
//Her mouth just stayed open.

// 15850
//“You know, like the Emperor and Darth Vader, only in reverse.”

// 15851
//“__Draco Malfoy__,” she said. “Harry, do you have __any idea -__”

// 15852
//“Yes.”

// 15853
//“- the sort of things Malfoy has been __saying__ about me? What he said
//he’d __do__ to me, as soon as he got the chance? I don’t know what he told
//to __you,__ but Daphne Greengrass told me what Malfoy says when he’s in
//Slytherin. It’s __unspeakable,__ Harry! It’s unspeakable in the completely
//literal sense that I can’t say it out loud!”

// 15854
//“When was this?” Harry said. “At the start of the year? Did Daphne say
//__when__ this was?”

// 15855
//“No,” Hermione said. “Because it doesn’t matter when, Harry. Anyone who said
//things - like Malfoy said - they can’t be a good person. It doesn’t matter what
//you tempted him to, he’s still a rotten person, because no matter __what__
//a good person would __never__ -”

// 15856
//“You’re wrong.” Harry said, looking her straight in the eyes. “I can guess what
//Draco threatened to do to you, because the second time I met him, he talked
//about doing it to a ten-year-old girl. But don’t you see, on the day Draco
//Malfoy arrived in Hogwarts, he’d spent his whole previous life being raised by
//__Death Eaters.__ It would’ve required a __supernatural
//intervention__ for him to have __your__ morality given __his__
//environment -”

// 15857
//Hermione was shaking her head violently. “__No,__ Harry. Nobody has to
//__tell__ you that hurting people is wrong, it’s not something you don’t do
//because the teacher says it’s not allowed, it’s something you don’t do because
//- because you can __see when people are hurting,__ don’t you know that,
//Harry?” Her voice was shaking now. “That’s not - that’s not a __rule
//__people follow like the rules for algebra! If you can’t __see__ it, if you
//can’t feel it __here,__” her hand slapped down over the center of her
//chest, not quite where her heart was located, but that didn’t matter because it
//was all really in the brain anyway, “then you just don’t have it!”

// 15858
//The thought came to her, then, that Harry might __not__ have it.

// 15859
//“There’s history books you haven’t read,” Harry said quietly. “There’s books
//you haven’t read yet, Hermione, and they might give you a sense of perspective.
//A few centuries earlier - I think it was definitely still around in the
//seventeenth century - it was a popular village entertainment to take a wicker
//basket, or a bundle, with a dozen live cats in it, and -”

// 15860
//“Stop,” she said.

// 15861
//“- roast it over a bonfire. Just a regular celebration. Good clean fun. And
//I’ll give them this, it was cleaner fun than burning women they thought were
//witches. Because the way people are built, Hermione, the way people are built
//to __feel__ inside -” Harry put a hand over his own heart, in the
//anatomically correct position, then paused and moved his hand up to point
//toward his head at around the ear level, “- is that they hurt when they see
//their __friends__ hurting. Someone inside their circle of concern, a
//member of their own tribe. That feeling has an off-switch, an off-switch
//labeled ‘enemy’ or ‘foreigner’ or sometimes just ‘stranger’. That’s how people
//are, if they don’t __learn__ otherwise. So, no, it does __not__
//indicate that Draco Malfoy was inhuman or even unusually evil, if he grew up
//believing that it was fun to hurt his enemies -”

// 15862
//“If you believe that__,__” she said with her voice unsteady, “if you
//__can__ believe that, then you’re evil. People are always responsible for
//what they do. It doesn’t matter what anyone __tells__ you to do, you’re
//the one who does it. Everyone knows that -”

// 15863
//“__No they don’t! __You grew up in a post-World-War-Two society where ‘I
//vas only followink orders’ is something __everyone knows__ the bad guys
//said. In the fifteenth century they would’ve called it honourable fealty.”
//Harry’s voice was rising. “Do you think you’re, you’re just
//__genetically__ better than everyone who lived back then? Like if you’d
//been transported back to fifteenth-century London as a baby, you’d realize
//__all on your own__ that burning cats was wrong, witch-burning was wrong,
//slavery was wrong, that every sentient being ought to be in your circle of
//concern? Do you think you’d __finish__ realizing all that by the first day
//you got to Hogwarts? Nobody ever __told__ Draco he was personally
//responsible for becoming more ethical than the society he grew up in. And
//__despite that__, it only took him four months to get to the point where
//he’d grab a Muggleborn falling off a building.” Harry’s eyes were as fierce as
//she’d ever seen him. “I’m not __finished__ corrupting Draco Malfoy, but I
//think __he’s done pretty well so far.__”

// 15864
//The problem with having such a good memory was that she __did__ remember.

// 15865
//She remembered Draco Malfoy grabbing her wrist, so hard she’d had a bruise
//afterward, while she was falling off the roof of Hogwarts.

// 15866
//She remembered Draco Malfoy helping her up, after that mysterious tripping jinx
//had sent her stumbling into the Slytherin Quidditch Captain’s plate of food.

// 15867
//And she remembered - it was, in fact, the reason she’d brought up the topic in
//the first place - how she’d felt when she’d heard Draco Malfoy’s testimony
//under Veritaserum.

// 15868
//“Why didn’t you __tell__ me any of this?” Hermione said, and despite
//herself, her voice rose in pitch. “If I’d __known__ -”

// 15869
//“It wasn’t my secret to tell you,” Harry said. “Draco’s the one who would’ve
//been at risk, if his father had found out.”

// 15870
//“I’m not stupid, Mr. Potter. What’s the __real__ reason you didn’t tell
//me, and what were you __actually__ doing with Mr. Malfoy?”

// 15871
//“Ah. Well…” Harry broke eye contact with her, and looked down at the library
//table.

// 15872
//“Draco Malfoy told the Aurors under Veritaserum that he wanted to know if he
//could beat me, so he challenged me to a duel to __test it empirically__.
//Those were his __exact words__ according to the transcript.”

// 15873
//“Right,” Harry said, still not meeting her eyes. “Hermione Granger. Of
//__course__ she’ll remember the exact wording. It doesn’t matter if she’s
//chained to her chair, on trial for murder in front of the entire Wizengamot -”

// 15874
//“What were you __really__ doing with Draco Malfoy?”

// 15875
//Harry winced, and said, “Probably not __quite__ what you’re thinking,
//but…”

// 15876
//The horror scaled and scaled within her, and finally broke loose.

// 15877
//“__You were doing SCIENCE with him?__”

// 15878
//“Well -”

// 15879
//“__You were doing SCIENCE with him? You were supposed to be doing science
//with ME!__”

// 15880
//“It wasn’t like that! It’s not like I was doing __real__ science with him!
//I was just, you know, __teaching__ him some harmless bits of Muggle
//science, like elementary physics with algebra and so on - it’s not like I was
//doing original magical research with him, the way I was with you -”

// 15881
//“And I suppose you didn’t tell __him__ about __me,__ either?”

// 15882
//“Um, of course not?” Harry said. “I’ve been doing science with him since
//October, and he wasn’t exactly ready to hear about you then -”

// 15883
//The inexpressible sense of betrayal inside her was welling and welling, taking
//over everything, her rising voice, her glaring eyes, her nose that she was
//certain was starting to run, the burning in her throat. She shoved herself up
//from the table and took a step back, the better to look down on her betrayer,
//and her voice was very nearly screeching as she yelled, “__That is not
//okay! You can’t do science with two people at once!__”

// 15884
//“Er -”

// 15885
//“I mean, you can’t do science with two different people and __not tell
//them about each other!__”

// 15886
//“Ah…” Harry said cautiously. “I __did__ think of that, and I was very
//careful not to get your research mixed together with anything I did with him -”

// 15887
//“You were being __careful.” __She would have __hissed __it, if it had
//contained any Ss.

// 15888
//Harry raised a hand and rubbed at his messy hair, and somehow that made her
//want to scream at him even __more.__ “Miss Granger,” said Harry, “I think
//this conversation has become __metaphorical__ on a level that’s, um…”

// 15889
//__“What?__” she screeched at him, at the top of her lungs inside their
//Quieting barrier.

// 15890
//Then she realized and got so red that if she’d had an adult level of magical
//power her hair would have spontaneously caught on fire.

// 15891
//The lone other patron in the library, the Ravenclaw boy sitting in the far
//opposite corner, was staring wide-eyed at both of them while making a rather
//sad attempt to conceal it by holding up a book just below his face.

// 15892
//“Right,” Harry said with a small sigh. “So, keeping __firmly in mind
//__that it was just a bad metaphor, and that __real scientists__ collaborate
//with each other __all the time,__ I don’t think that I was cheating.
//Scientists often keep quiet about projects they’re working on. You and I are
//doing research that we’re keeping secret, and there were reasons not to tell
//Draco Malfoy in particular - he wouldn’t have stayed around me at all, in the
//beginning, if he’d known I was your friend and not your rival. And Draco
//would’ve been the one at risk if I’d told anyone else about __him__ -”

// 15893
//“Is that really all?” she said. “__Really,__ Harry? You didn’t want both
//of us to __feel special,__ like we were the __only__ ones you wanted
//to be with and the __only__ ones who got to be with you?”

// 15894
//“That was __not__ why I -”

// 15895
//Harry paused.

// 15896
//Harry looked at her.

// 15897
//All the blood was rushing back into her face, there probably should’ve been
//steam coming out of her ears, which in turn should’ve been melting off her head
//with the liquid flesh running down into her neck, as she realized what she’d
//just blurted out.

// 15898
//Harry was staring at her in dawning and complete terror.

// 15899
//“Well…” she said in a rather high-pitched voice, “it’s… oh, I don’t know,
//Harry! __Is__ it just a metaphor? When a boy spends a hundred thousand
//Galleons to save a girl from certain doom, she’s entitled to wonder, don’t you
//think? It’s like being bought flowers, only, you see, rather __more__ so
//-”

// 15900
//Harry shoved himself up from the table and took a staggering step back, even as
//he brought up his arms to wave frantically. __“That’s not why I did it! I
//did it because we’re friends!__”

// 15901
//“Just friends?”

// 15902
//Harry Potter’s breathing was starting to scale up toward hyperventilation.
//“Very good friends! Extra-special friends, even! Best friends forever,
//possibly! But not __that__ kind of friends!”

// 15903
//“Is it really that awful to think about?” she said with a catch in her voice.
//“I mean - I’m not saying __I’m__ in love with __you,__ but -”

// 15904
//“Oh, you’re not? Thank __goodness.__” Harry brought up the sleeve of his
//robe and wiped across his forehead. “Look, Hermione, please don’t
//misunderstand, I’m sure you’re a wonderful person -”

// 15905
//She took a staggering step back.

// 15906
//“- but - even with my dark side -”

// 15907
//“Is __that__ what this is about?” said Hermione. “But I - I wouldn’t -”

// 15908
//“No, no, I mean, I have a mysterious dark side and probably other weird magic
//stuff going on, you __know__ I’m not a normal child, not really -”

// 15909
//“It’s okay to not be normal,” she said, feeling increasingly desperate and
//confused. __“I’m__ okay with it -”

// 15910
//“But __even with all that weird magical stuff __letting me be more adult
//than I should be, I haven’t gone through puberty yet and there’s no hormones in
//my bloodstream and my brain is __physically incapable__ of falling in love
//with anyone. So I’m not in love with you! I couldn’t possibly be in love with
//you! For all I know at this point, six months from now my brain is going to
//wake up and decide to fall in love with Professor Snape! Er, can I take it from
//this that you __have__ been through puberty?”

// 15911
//“Eep,” said Hermione in a high-pitched sound. She swayed where she stood, and a
//moment later Harry was rushing over to her side and helping lower her to sit on
//the ground, bracing her body with firm hands.

// 15912
//The fact was that she __had__ staggered over to Professor McGonagall’s
//office back in December, not in total surprise because she’d done her reading,
//but still rather __queasily__ and it was with great relief that she’d
//learned that witches had Charms to deal with the inconveniences and
//__what was Harry even doing asking a poor innocent girl a question like
//that -__

// 15913
//“Look, I’m __sorry__,” Harry said frantically. “I really didn’t mean most
//of that the way it sounded! I’m sure that anyone taking the outside view of the
//whole situation and offering betting odds on who I finally married would assign
//a higher probability to you than anyone else I can think of -”

// 15914
//Her intelligence, which had barely been starting to pull itself together,
//promptly exploded into sparks and flame.

// 15915
//“- though not necessarily a probability higher than fifty percent, I mean, from
//the outside view there’s a lot of other possibilities, and who I like before I
//hit puberty probably isn’t all that strongly __diagnostic__ of who I’ll be
//with seven years later - I don’t want to sound like I’m __promising
//__anything -”

// 15916
//Her throat was making some sort of high-pitched sounds and she wasn’t really
//listening to exactly what. All her universe had narrowed to Harry’s terrible,
//terrible voice.

// 15917
//“- and besides I’ve been reading about evolutionary psychology, and, well,
//there are all these suggestions that one man and one woman living together
//happily ever afterward may be more the exception rather than the rule, and in
//hunter-gatherer tribes it was more often just staying together for two or three
//years to raise a child during its most vulnerable stages - and, I mean,
//considering how many people end up horribly unhappy in traditional marriages,
//it seems like it might be the sort of thing that needs some clever reworking -
//especially if we actually do solve immortality -”

***

// 15918
//Tano Wolfe, of fifth-year Ravenclaw, slowly stood up from his library desk,
//from which vantage point he’d just watched Granger flee the library, sobbing.
//He hadn’t been able to hear the argument, but it had clearly been one of
//__those.__

// 15919
//Slowly and with his knees trembling, Tano approached the Boy-Who-Lived, who was
//staring in the direction of the library doors, still vibrating from the force
//of how they’d been slammed.

// 15920
//Tano didn’t particularly want to do this, but Harry Potter __had__ been
//Sorted into Ravenclaw. The Boy-Who-Lived was, technically, his fellow
//Ravenclaw. And that meant there was a Code.

// 15921
//The Boy-Who-Lived didn’t say anything as Tano approached him, but his gaze
//wasn’t friendly.

// 15922
//Tano swallowed, laid a hand on Harry Potter’s shoulder, and recited, his voice
//cracking only slightly, “Witches! Go figure, huh?”

// 15923
//“__Remove your hand before I cast it into the outer darkness.__”

// 15924
//The library doors slammed open again in the wake of another departure.
