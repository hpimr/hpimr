//== Shut Up and Do The Impossible, Pt 2

// 19238
//__This is a double post. If you have not read Ch. 114, go back and read
//it now.__

// 19239
//Something like a fugue state had come over Harry’s mind. The absolute state had
//partially worn off him, partially stayed with him. Elements of his mind were
//numb, maybe deliberately numbed by some part that was smart enough to predict
//what would happen otherwise. What he’d just done -

// 19240
//The thought was shut off, making space for an awareness of other things.

// 19241
//Harry was standing in the middle of a haphazard graveyard, tombstones scattered
//without order.

// 19242
//By moonlight and starlight, it could be seen that black robes littered the
//ground, surrounded by textures that didn’t match the surrounding graveyard
//earth, wetness tinged red in the moonlight. Some heads had come loose from the
//surrounding hoods of the robes, revealing hair that was long or short, dark or
//bright, which was all that could be seen beneath the moon. The silver masks
//stayed on, making all the hair originate in skulls instead of human faces -

// 19243
//The thought was shut off, making space for awareness of other things.

// 19244
//A girl in a red-trimmed Hogwarts uniform slept upon an altar. Near the altar,
//Harry’s things lay in a heap.

// 19245
//Upon the ground lay a too-tall pale man of inhuman face, blood pouring from the
//stumps of his wrists.

// 19246
//__As soon as the Dark Lord Voldemort awakens, he will destroy everything
//you love. Dumbledore is no longer there to stop him.__

// 19247
//__He cannot be imprisoned, for he can abandon his body at any time.__

// 19248
//__He cannot be killed permanently, not without destroying more than a
//hundred horcruxes, one of which is the Pioneer plaque.__

// 19249
//__Materials: One wand, you are allowed to point it and speak this time.__

// 19250
//__You have five minutes.__

// 19251
//__Solve.__

// 19252
//Harry stumbled toward the altar, knelt at its side, and picked up his pouch.

// 19253
//He walked toward where Voldemort lay.

// 19254
//The sense of apprehension had diminished, after Voldemort had been hexed
//unconscious. Now, as Harry approached, it rose to a terrifying height, flaring
//also into pain in his scar.

// 19255
//Harry ignored the inner shriek. That had been the last memory of Tom Riddle
//seared into Harry’s brain, the last cognitive pattern to be transferred over
//into the infant baby before Tom Riddle had exploded: a sense of mounting horror
//and dismay associated with the resonance that had spun out of control. Harry
//knew the meaning of it now, that sense of apprehension, and that made it easier
//to disregard. He’d guessed that the effect of the resonance mostly hit the
//caster, with power proportional to the caster’s power, and the bet had paid
//off.

// 19256
//Harry looked upon Voldemort’s body, and breathed deeply - through his mouth,
//because coppery smells Harry was not thinking about were coming in through his
//nose.

// 19257
//Harry knelt by Voldemort’s side, took out his medical kit from his pouch, and
//placed a self-tightening tourniquet around the body’s left wrist, then another
//tourniquet about the right.

// 19258
//It felt __wrong,__ showing Voldemort that concern. Some part of Harry was
//aware, in the back of his mind, that some number of people had just had
//something extremely bad happen to them. What would have been balance, what
//would have been justice, was if Voldemort had suffered the same fate without an
//instant’s more hesitation. What Harry was doing now felt like Batman showing
//more concern for the Joker than for the Joker’s victims; it felt like a comic
//book where the writers wrung their hands endlessly about the morality of
//killing the Big Named Villains while innocents went on dying in the background.
//To show more solicitousness for the head villain than his minions, to pay
//__more attention __to his fate than the fates of his lower-status
//followers, was a flaw in human nature.

// 19259
//So it felt wrong when Harry rose up from beside the body, the tourniquets
//having tightened upon Voldemort’s wrists; it felt like Harry was doing
//something ethically monstrous.

// 19260
//Even though any sane strategic thinking said that Voldemort’s body __must
//not__ die. The soul he’d created for himself had to be anchored in this brain,
//it mustn’t be allowed to float free.

// 19261
//Harry stepped back, back from Voldemort’s unconscious body, breathing deeply
//through his mouth. He went to the pile of his things, to put on his robes and
//other items, starting with placing the Time-Turner around his throat once more,
//readying his own escape and return if that was required…

// 19262
//More than a hundred horcruxes.

// 19263
//That had been insane, there wasn’t any other word for it, a sign of Voldemort’s
//damaged thinking about death. A Muggle security expert would have called it
//fence-post security, like building a fence-post over a hundred metres high in
//the middle of the desert. Only a very obliging attacker would try to climb the
//fence-post. Anyone sensible would just walk around the fence-post, and making
//the fence-post even higher wouldn’t stop that.

// 19264
//Once you forgot to be scared of how impossible the problem was supposed to be,
//it wasn’t even difficult, not by comparison to the last one.

// 19265
//Neville’s parents, for example, had been Crucioed into permanent insanity. Two
//hundred advanced horcruxes wouldn’t prevent that insanity, they would all just
//echo the same damaged mind.

// 19266
//It would be an ethically justified use of the Cruciatus Curse, if that were the
//only way to stop Voldemort permanently. It would be justice, balance, it would
//show that the Joker’s life wasn’t worth more than his meanest henchman…

// 19267
//All Harry needed to do was cast the Patronus Charm, send it to… Alastor Moody?…
//and tell him to come here. Well, no, it was a pretty good guess the Patronus
//Charm wouldn’t work if it was cast with __that__ intent. Maybe just
//resolve to tell Moody that, and use his Time-Turner once he was out of range of
//Voldemort’s wards.

// 19268
//And then Voldemort could be Crucioed into permanent insanity.

// 19269
//It wasn’t even the least merciful fate. That would have been throwing
//Voldemort’s wand into the pit at Azkaban, if the wand stayed connected to
//Voldemort’s life and magic no matter where his ghost tried to flee.

// 19270
//Harry turned to face where Voldemort lay. He walked forward, and continued to
//control his breathing, ignoring the burning feeling in his throat. Some part of
//him knew that Voldemort was __also__ Professor Quirrell, even though his
//body now was different. Even though the shift of personality had been perfect
//and that meant that Professor Quirrell had been just another mask…

// 19271
//Though Voldemort hadn’t planned to kill Harry painfully. Hadn’t thought to
//strike Harry with his followers’ Cruciatus, when Harry was being annoying
//before. That meant something, when your opponent was Voldemort. Maybe he’d had
//some remaining shred of fellow-feeling for the other Tom Riddle after all.

// 19272
//…it would be wrong to take that into account.

// 19273
//Wouldn’t it?

// 19274
//Harry looked back up at the stars. Here below the atmosphere the stars
//twinkled, they were embedded in the false dome of the night sky, stretched out
//across the wash of the Milky Way that glowed like a long ribbon, as if they
//were all close enough that you could fly up to them on a broomstick and touch
//them.

// 19275
//What would they want him to do now at this juncture, the children’s children’s
//children?

// 19276
//The answer to that also felt obvious, if it wasn’t just the part of Harry that
//still cared about Professor Quirrell doing the real talking.

// 19277
//Harry had needed to do the thing he’d done, it __had__ prevented greater
//evils, Harry couldn’t have stopped Voldemort if the Death Eaters had fired
//first. But that thing Harry had done wasn’t something that could be balanced by
//a not-necessary tragedy happening to one more sentient being, even if that
//being was Voldemort. It would just be one more element of the sorrows of
//ancient Earth so long ago.

// 19278
//The past was past. You did what you had to do, and you didn’t do one scrap of
//harm more than that. Not even to balance things out, and make it all
//symmetrical.

// 19279
//The children’s children’s children wouldn’t want Voldemort to die, even if his
//minions had. They wouldn’t want Voldemort to hurt, if it didn’t accomplish
//anything compared to him not hurting.

// 19280
//Harry breathed deeply, and let go of - not his hate - not quite his hate - he
//hadn’t been able to hate his creator even at the very end - but even so, Harry
//let go of __something__. Of the sense that he __ought__ to hate
//Voldemort, that it was a hate he was obligated to feel, for the endless list of
//crimes that Voldemort had committed for no good reason, not even his own
//happiness…

// 19281
//__It’s all right,__ the stars whispered down at him. __It’s all
//right not to hate him. It doesn’t make you a bad person.__

// 19282
//In the end, there was only one option he would take, and since Harry already
//knew that, there was no point agonizing about it. Whether it was the best
//option, only time would tell.

// 19283
//Harry breathed deeply, building up the magic inside himself. The spell he was
//going to cast didn’t need to be __precise,__ but it was still one of the
//most powerful spells he’d mastered.

// 19284
//Harry thought again of how unjust it was that Voldemort could not die with his
//followers, felt the slight trace of coldness in his blood that came with
//thoughts of ruthlessness. And then Harry let it go, let it all drain away
//beneath the starlight, because his dark side had never been anything except an
//inherited pattern of cognition, just one more bad habit of thinking to break.

// 19285
//Instead Harry looked at Hermione’s breathing form atop the altar, and let the
//tears finally start from his eyes. What would become of Hermione now, what path
//she would choose after this, Harry couldn’t guess; but she would be
//__there__ to have a choice, their friendship wouldn’t have destroyed her
//existence. He hadn’t realised how shaky his hope had been, until he’d noticed
//how surprised he’d been after the hope had come true. Sometimes things did go
//better than expected.

// 19286
//And Harry took that thought, too, and put it into the magic he was building.

// 19287
//The power he was storing up was vibrating in him, like his whole body was part
//of his wand, either Harry’s eyes were blurring or there was a luminous white
//quiver running over the holly. And Harry thought the shape of the spell he
//would cast, he didn’t have much fine control but the pattern he needed was
//simple, it just needed to include -

// 19288
//__Everything, forget everything, Tom Riddle, Professor Quirrell, forget
//your whole life, forget your entire episodic memory, forget the disappointment
//and the bitterness and the wrong decisions, forget Voldemort -__

// 19289
//And at the last moment before Harry cast the spell, he had one final thought, a
//note of grace -

// 19290
//__But if you ever had any truly happy memories, not hurting people or
//laughing at their pain, but the warm feeling of helping someone or being
//helped, there won’t be many, maybe just when you were a child, but if you had
//any truly happy memories then keep only those -__

// 19291
//Something bright in him unfolded at the decision, knowing he’d made the right
//choice, and Harry pushed that too into his wand -

// 19292
//**“OBLIVIATE!”**

// 19293
//And it all poured out of Harry into the spell.

// 19294
//Harry fell over on his side, dropping his wand, gritted screams coming from his
//throat, his hands going helplessly to his scar, even as the sudden blast of
//pain in his head began to fade. Only dimly did his eyes see that the air was
//filled with glowing snowflakes, drifting motes of silver light like tiny specks
//of Patronus Charm.

// 19295
//Only a moment the silver light lasted, and then it was gone.

// 19296
//Professor Quirrell was gone.

// 19297
//Nothing left but a remnant.

// 19298
//And that spirit, what remained of it, wouldn’t be so different now from Harry’s
//own.

// 19299
//The Prophecy was complete.

// 19300
//They had each remade the other in their own image.

// 19301
//Harry started sobbing, then, from where he was curled up in the dirt.

// 19302
//He cried for a while.

// 19303
//And then eventually Harry staggered to his feet and picked up his wand again,
//because this day’s work wasn’t quite done.

// 19304
//Harry laid his wand directly on Voldemort’s wrist-stump; it made his scar throb
//with an ongoing pain, but neither of them exploded.

// 19305
//And Harry began a Transfiguration.

// 19306
//Slowly - though faster than Harry had been able to Transfigure Hermione’s body,
//last time - the stunned form of the snake-man changed, reshaped itself. As the
//Transfiguration progressed, especially as the snake-man’s head began to turn
//glassy and shrunken, the pain in Harry’s scar faded.

// 19307
//It would be a spell to maintain whether Harry was waking or sleeping; and
//later, when Harry was older and more powerful and maybe had some help, he would
//un-Transfigure the mindwiped Tom Riddle and heal his body with the power of the
//Stone. __After__ future-Harry had figured out what to do with an
//almost-completely-amnesiac wizard who still had some bad habits of thought and
//some highly negative emotional patterns - a dark side, as ‘twere - plus a great
//deal of declarative and procedural knowledge about powerful magic. Harry had
//tried his best __not__ to Obliviate that part, because he might need it,
//someday.

// 19308
//And meanwhile, just like magic hadn’t defined a Transfigured unicorn as dead
//for purposes of setting off wards, Voldemort’s horcruxes wouldn’t define a
//Transfigured Voldemort as dead and try to bring him back.

// 19309
//That was the hope, anyway.

// 19310
//Harry’s scar twinged one last time when the steel ring went on his pinky
//finger, holding the tiny green emerald in contact with his skin. Then his scar
//subsided, and did not hurt again.

// 19311
//An upthrust rock served Harry for a chair, when he staggered over it and sat
//down motionless, resting after a fashion, shoving back the exhaustion that
//threatened the corners of his mind. __It was not done, there was more to
//do.__

// 19312
//Harry took another deep breath, still inhaling through his mouth, said
//__“Lumos,”__ and looked around the graveyard.

// 19313
//Black robes and severed skull masks, surrounded by pools of blood -

// 19314
//Hermione Granger, asleep on an altar.

// 19315
//Voldemort’s empty robes and bloody hands, lying where the Dark Lord had fallen.

// 19316
//Quirinus Quirrell with his shredded robes, fallen in a heap where the Killing
//Curse had stricken him.

// 19317
//Harry imagined someone else looking at this scene, trying to understand it, and
//shook his head, because that wouldn’t do, it wouldn’t do at all.

// 19318
//Then Harry shoved himself up from his rock, grimacing as his mind, if not body,
//protested. He hadn’t been bloodied or beaten much today, but somehow Harry’s
//body was managing to feel like all the stress had hit it directly.

// 19319
//Harry staggered over toward where Voldemort had fallen, and picked up
//Voldemort’s left hand from where it lay upon the ground.

// 19320
//Even in just the left hand, you could see the faint trace of snake’s scales; it
//was very distinctively Voldemort. That was good.

// 19321
//Harry went to the altar where the sleeping Hermione lay, and gently placed the
//detached hand around Hermione’s neck, carefully moving the fingers to clutch at
//her throat. It was hard to do, Hermione seemed so peaceful and innocent when
//she was sleeping, and Voldemort’s severed hand seemed so ugly; Harry bluntly
//overrode whatever part of his mind was thinking that, since it made no sense in
//context.

// 19322
//A few weak Severing Charms served to mess up the almost perfectly fine cut the
//nanofiber had made, which was critical; it would not do to have the hand-stump
//look like the neck-stumps. The multiple __Diffindos__ scattered small bits
//of Voldemort-wrist all over Hermione’s shirt, which, Harry had to remind
//himself, was also part of the plan.

// 19323
//Harry repeated this with the right hand, arranging it symmetrically with the
//left.

// 19324
//Harry used __Inflammare__ to singe Voldemort’s robes where they lay, and
//then arranged the singed clothing around Hermione.

// 19325
//Voldemort’s gun, and his wand, went into Harry’s pouch. Harry placed the Stone
//of Permanency in an ordinary pocket, he wasn’t sure what the Stone might do to
//his pouch.

// 19326
//The heap of things from inside Quirrell’s robe, also near the altar, yielded
//the wand that the Defense Professor had used when he was being Quirrell. Harry
//went to where Quirrell lay, and straightened out the body as best he could, and
//put Quirrell’s wand into his hand. Tears predictably came to Harry’s eyes, and
//Harry wiped them away on his sleeve.

// 19327
//Harry took another deep breath, still inhaling through his mouth, said
//__“Lumos”__ again, and once more looked around the graveyard.

// 19328
//Black robes, severed skull masks, and Hermione Granger lying on an altar with
//Voldemort’s severed hands clutched around her throat, and Voldemort’s singed
//clothing scattered around her. Quirinus Quirrell lay dead with his clothes torn
//and shredded, his wand in his right hand.

// 19329
//That would do.

// 19330
//There remained the problem of calling attention to it.

// 19331
//Harry was very nearly out of magic at this point. But he still had enough left
//to Transfigure a leaf into the deflated form of a three-meter weather balloon.

// 19332
//Harry’s pouch produced a bottle of oxyacetelene, and a stick of dynamite, and a
//spool of fuse-cord. __Be prepared, that’s the Boy Scout’s marching song,
//be prepared for a life that includes mountain trolls and who knows what else…__

// 19333
//Harry inflated the weather balloon with the oxyacetelene. That would produce a
//very sharp overpressure when it detonated, maybe as loud as a sonic boom.

// 19334
//He attached the stick of dynamite - it was overkill, for detonation, but it
//would do.

// 19335
//He attached a 60-second fuse to the stick of dynamite, but did not light it
//yet.

// 19336
//Harry put on his Cloak of Invisibility, that had been among the piles by the
//sacrificial altar.

// 19337
//He obtained his broomstick from his pouch, and mounted it.

// 19338
//Harry cast a Quieting Charm around Hermione Granger - it wouldn’t stop
//__all__ the noise, not even close, and it wasn’t like she’d be permanently
//hurt if her eardrums burst, but it still seemed polite.

// 19339
//And then that was it. The Quieting Charm had done it. Harry was drained of
//magic for at least the next hour.

// 19340
//Harry mounted the broomstick, slowly rising into the air, lifting the weather
//balloon filled with oxyacetelene with him. The castle Hogwarts came into view,
//distantly gleaming in moonlight a few kilometers away, as Harry rose above the
//trees; and Harry did his best to figure the distance, and the angle as it would
//be seen from Hogwarts.

// 19341
//When he had risen high above the forest, Harry used a lighter to ignite the
//fuse on the dynamite attached to the weather balloon full of oxyacetelene. Then
//Harry spun the broomstick and darted away - though not directly toward the
//castle, that might take him too close to the route past-Harry and Professor
//Quirrell had traversed, it wouldn’t do to have the Professor sense another
//Harry -

// 19342
//Harry felt a leaden stab of sadness, and refused it.

// 19343
//__Thirty-one one-thousand, thirty-two one-thousand, thirty-three
//one-thousand…__

// 19344
//When Harry reached forty, not wanting to take chances with his own eardrums, he
//glanced at his wristwatch, noting the exact time, and spun his Time-Turner
//once.

// 19345
