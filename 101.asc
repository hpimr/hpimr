//== Precautionary Measures, Pt 2

// 17484
//Harry stood, panting, in the midst of a brief wasted circle amid the forest,
//more destruction than a first-year should have been able to reach, by himself.
//The Severing Charm wouldn’t bring down a tree, so he’d started partially
//Transfiguring cross-sections through the wood. It hadn’t let out what was
//inside him, bringing down a small circle of trees hadn’t made him feel any
//better, all the emotions were still there but while he was destroying trees he
//at least wasn’t thinking about how the feelings couldn’t be let out.

// 17485
//After Harry had run out of available magic he’d started tearing off branches
//with his bare hands and snapping them. His hands were bleeding, though nothing
//that Madam Pomfrey couldn’t fix in the morning. Only Dark magic left permanent
//scars on wizards.

// 17486
//There came a sound of something moving in the woods, like the hoofbeats of a
//horse, and Harry whirled, his wand rising once more; some part of his magic had
//returned while he was working with his hands. It occurred to him for the first
//time that he was out in the Forbidden Forest alone, and making noise.

// 17487
//What emerged into the moonlight was not the unicorn Harry had expected, but a
//creature with a lower body like that of a horse, gleaming white-brown beneath
//the moonlight, and the bare upper chest of a male human with long white hair.
//The moonlight caught the centaur’s face, and Harry saw that the eyes were
//almost as blue as Dumbledore’s, halfway to sapphire.

// 17488
//In one hand the centaur held a long wooden spear, with an overlarge metal blade
//whose edge did not gleam beneath the moonlight; a gleaming edge, Harry had once
//read, was the sign of a dull blade.

// 17489
//“So,” the centaur said. His voice was low, powerful and male. “Here you are,
//surrounded by destruction. I can smell the unicorn’s blood in the air, the
//blood of something innocent, slain to save oneself.”

// 17490
//A jolt of sudden fear brought Harry into the now, and he said quickly, “It’s
//not what it looks like.”

// 17491
//“I know. The stars themselves proclaim your innocence, ironically enough.” The
//centaur took a step toward Harry within the small clearing, still holding his
//spear upright. “A strange word, __innocence. __It means lack of knowledge,
//like the innocence of a child, and also means lack of guilt. Only those
//entirely ignorant can lack all responsibility for the consequences of their
//actions. He knows not what he does, and therefore can be without harmful
//intent; so says that word.” The deep voice did not echo in the woods.

// 17492
//Harry’s eyes flickered to the spear-tip, and he realized that he should have
//grabbed his Time-Turner the moment he saw the centaur. Now, if Harry tried to
//reach beneath his robes, the spear could strike him before then, if the centaur
//was fast enough. “I read once,” Harry said, his voice a bit unsteady as he
//tried to match deep-sounding words to deep-sounding words, “that it’s wrong to
//think of little children as innocent, because not knowing isn’t the same as not
//choosing. That children do little harms to each other with schoolyard fights,
//because they don’t have the power to do great harm. And some adults do great
//harm. But the adults who don’t, aren’t they more innocent than children, not
//less?”

// 17493
//“The wisdom of wizards,” the centaur said.

// 17494
//“Muggle wisdom, actually.”

// 17495
//“Of the magicless I know little. Mars has been dim of late, but it grows
//brighter.” The centaur took another step forwards, bringing him almost within
//striking distance of Harry.

// 17496
//Harry didn’t dare look up to the sky. “That means Mars is coming closer to the
//Earth, as both planets go around the Sun. Mars is reflecting the same amount of
//sunlight as always, it’s just getting nearer to us. What do you mean, the stars
//proclaim my innocence?”

// 17497
//“The night sky speaks to centaurs. It is how we know what we know. Or do they
//not even tell wizards that much, these days?” A look of contempt crossed the
//centaur’s face.

// 17498
//“I… tried to look up centaurs, when I was checking out Divination. Most of the
//authors just ridiculed centaur Divination without explaining why, wizards don’t
//understand argumentative norms, to them ridiculing an idea or a person feels
//like casting that idea down just as much as bringing evidence against it… I
//thought the part about centaurs using astrology was just more ridicule…”

// 17499
//“Why?” the centaur intoned. His head cocked curiously.

// 17500
//“Because the course of the planets is predictable for thousands of years in
//advance. If I talked to the right Muggles, I could show you a diagram of
//exactly what the planets will look like from this spot ten years later. Would
//you be able to make predictions from that?”

// 17501
//The centaur shook his head. “From a diagram? No. The light of the planets, the
//comets, the subtle shifts in the stars themselves, those I would not see.”

// 17502
//“Cometary orbits are also set thousands of years in advance so they shouldn’t
//correlate much to current events. And the light of the stars takes years to
//travel from the stars to Earth, and the stars don’t move much at all, not
//visibly. So the obvious hypothesis is that centaurs have a native magical
//talent for Divination which you just, well, __project__ onto the night
//sky.”

// 17503
//“Perhaps,” the centaur said thoughtfully. His head lowered. “The others would
//strike you for saying such a thing, but I have ever sought to know what I do
//not know. Why the night sky can foretell the future - that I surely do not
//know. It is hard enough to grasp the skill itself. All I can say, son of Lily,
//is that even if what you are saying is true, it does not seem useful.”

// 17504
//Harry allowed himself to relax a little; being addressed as ‘son of Lily’
//implied that the centaur thought of him as more than a random intruder in the
//forest. Besides, attacking a Hogwarts student would probably bring some kind of
//huge reprisal upon the non-wizard centaur tribe in the forests, and the centaur
//probably knew that… “What Muggles have learned is that there is a power in the
//truth, in all the pieces of the truth which interact with each other, which you
//can only find by discovering as many truths as possible. To do that you can’t
//defend false beliefs in any way, not even by saying the false belief is useful.
//It might not seem to matter whether your predictions are really based on the
//stars or if it’s an innate talent being projected. But if you wanted to really
//understand Divination, or for that matter the stars, the real truth about
//centaur predictions would be a fact that matters to other truths.”

// 17505
//Slowly the centaur nodded. “So the wandless have become wiser than the wizards.
//What a joke! Tell me, son of Lily, do the Muggles in their wisdom say that soon
//the skies will be empty?”

// 17506
//“Empty?” Harry said. “Er… no?”

// 17507
//“The other centaurs in this forest have stayed from your presence, for we are
//sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens’ course. Because, in becoming
//entangled in your fate, we might become less innocent in what is to come. I
//alone have dared approach you.”

// 17508
//“I… don’t understand.”

// 17509
//“No. You are innocent, as the stars say. And to slay something innocent to save
//oneself, that is a terrible deed. One would live only a cursed life, a
//half-life, from that day. For any centaur would surely be cast out, if he slew
//a foal.”

// 17510
//The spear made a lightning motion, too fast for Harry’s eyes to follow, and
//smashed his wand out of his hand.

// 17511
//Another powerful blow smashed into Harry’s solar plexus, and he went gasping
//and retching to the forest floor.

// 17512
//Harry’s hand reached up toward his robes, for his Time-Turner, and the
//spear-butt knocked his hand away, almost hard enough to break fingers, he
//reached with his other hand and that was knocked away too -

// 17513
//“I am sorry, Harry Potter,” the centaur said, and then looked up with widened
//eyes. The spear spun about and came up, intercepting a red spellbolt. Then the
//centaur dropped the spear and leaped away desperately, a green flash of light
//went past him and another green flash of light followed in its wake, then a
//third green flash hit the centaur straight-on.

// 17514
//The centaur fell and did not move again.

// 17515
//It took a long time for Harry to catch his breath, to stagger to his feet, to
//pick up his wand, to croak, “What?”

// 17516
//By that time the sense of doom, of power almost tangible in the air, had
//approached once more.

// 17517
//“P-Professor Quirrell? What are you doing here?”

// 17518
//“Well,” the man in the black cloak said thoughtfully, “__you__ needed to
//fly into a rage and have a loud tantrum in the Forbidden Forest in the middle
//of the night, and__ I__ needed to go just outside your ability to detect
//me and keep watch. One does not leave a student alone in the Forbidden Forest.
//That should be obvious in retrospect.”

// 17519
//Harry stared at the fallen centaur.

// 17520
//The horse-form wasn’t breathing.

// 17521
//“You - you __killed__ him, that was Avada Kedavra -”

// 17522
//“I do not always understand how other people imagine morality to work, Mr.
//Potter. But even I know that on conventional morality, it is acceptable to kill
//nonhuman creatures which are about to slay a wizard child. Perhaps you do not
//care about the nonhuman part, but he was about to __kill__ you. He was
//hardly innocent -”

// 17523
//The Defense Professor stopped, looking at Harry, who had raised one trembling
//hand to his mouth.

// 17524
//“Well,” the Defense Professor said then, “I have made my point, and you may
//think on it. Centaur spears can block many spells, but no one tries to block if
//they see that the spell is a certain shade of green. For this purpose it is
//useful to know some green stunning hexes. Really, Mr. Potter, you should
//understand by now how I operate.”

// 17525
//The Defense Professor came nearer the centaur’s body, and Harry took an
//involuntary step back, then another, at the terrible rising sense of
//__STOP, DON’T -__

// 17526
//The Defense Professor kneeled and pressed his wand to the centaur’s head.

// 17527
//The wand stayed there for a time.

// 17528
//And the centaur rose, eyes blank, breathing once more.

// 17529
//“Remember nothing of this time,” the Defense Professor commanded. “Wander away
//and forget everything about this night.”

// 17530
//The centaur walked away, the four horse-legs moving in strange synchrony.

// 17531
//“Happy now?” the Defense Professor said, sounding rather sardonic about it.

// 17532
//Harry’s brain still felt broken. “He was trying to __kill__ me.”

// 17533
//“Oh, for Merlin’s sake - yes, he was trying to kill you. Get used to it. Only
//boring people never have that experience.”

// 17534
//Harry’s voice emerged, hoarse. “Why - why did he want to -”

// 17535
//“Any number of reasons. I would be lying if I said I’d never considered killing
//you myself.”

// 17536
//Harry stared at where the centaur had wandered into the trees.

// 17537
//His brain still felt half-broken, like an engine misfiring, but Harry did not
//see how this could possibly be a good sign.

// 17538
//The news of Draco Malfoy nearly being eaten by a horror had been sufficient to
//summon back Dumbledore from wherever he’d gone, to wake Lord Malfoy and the
//Lady Greengrass’s handsome husband, to bring forth Amelia Bones. The supposed
//presence of the horror had provoked skepticism even from Dumbledore, and the
//possibility of False Memory Charms had been raised. Harry had said (after some
//internal debate about the consequences of people believing a demon was on the
//loose) that he didn’t actually remember making the same effort he’d put forth
//to frighten the Dementor, the dark thing had just left; which was what you
//would expect someone to create as a False Memory, if they hadn’t actually known
//how Harry had done it. The names of Bellatrix Black, Severus Snape, and
//Quirinus Quirrell had been mentioned in connection with wizards strong enough
//to subdue everyone present and cast False Memory Charms, and Harry had known
//that Lucius was thinking of Dumbledore. There had been Aurors testifying, and
//discussions going in circles, and glares of accusation, and cutting remarks at
//2AM in the morning. There had been motions, and votes, and consequences.

// 17539
//“Do you believe,” Headmaster Dumbledore said quietly to Harry, when all of it
//was done, and the two of them alone, “that the Hogwarts you have wrought is an
//improvement?”

// 17540
//Harry sat with his elbows on his knees, his face resting on his palms, in the
//conference room from which all the others had now departed. Professor
//McGonagall, who did not use a Time-Turner as routinely as the two of them, had
//departed swiftly for her bed.

// 17541
//“Yes,” Harry answered after too long a hesitation. “From my perspective,
//Headmaster, things in Hogwarts are finally, finally normal. This is how things
//should be, when four children get sent into the Forbidden Forest at night.
//There should be a huge fuss, constables showing up, and the responsible party
//getting sacked.”

// 17542
//“You believe it is good,” Dumbledore said quietly, “that the man who you call
//responsible was, as you put it, sacked.”

// 17543
//“Yes, in fact, I do.”

// 17544
//“Argus Filch has served this institution for decades.”

// 17545
//“And when given Veritaserum,” Harry said tiredly, “Argus Filch revealed that he
//had sent an eleven-year-old boy into the Forbidden Forest, hoping something
//awful would happen to him, because he thought the boy’s father had been
//responsible for the death of his cat. The three other students in Draco’s
//company don’t seem to have fazed him. I would have argued for jail time, but
//your concept of jail in this country is Azkaban. I’ll also note that Filch was
//remarkably unpleasant to the children in Hogwarts and I expect the school’s
//hedonic index to be improved by his departure, not that it matters to you, I
//suppose.”

// 17546
//The Headmaster’s eyes were impenetrable behind the half-moon glasses. “Argus
//Filch is a Squib. His work at Hogwarts is all he has. Had, rather.”

// 17547
//“The purpose of a school is not to provide work for its employees. I know you
//probably spent more time around Filch than around any individual student, but
//that shouldn’t make Filch’s inner experiences loom larger in your thoughts.
//Students have inner lives too.”

// 17548
//“You don’t care at all, do you Harry?” Dumbledore’s voice was quiet. “About
//those you hurt.”

// 17549
//“I care about the innocent,” Harry said. “Like Mr. Hagrid, who you’ll note I
//argued should not be considered malicious, just oblivious. I was fine with Mr.
//Hagrid working here so long as he didn’t take anyone into the Forbidden Forest
//again.”

// 17550
//“I had thought that with Rubeus vindicated, he might teach Care of Magical
//Creatures after Silvanus departs the position. But much of that teaching is
//done in the Forbidden Forest. So that too shall not be, in the wake of your
//passage.”

// 17551
//Harry said slowly, “But - you told us that Mr. Hagrid has a blind spot when it
//comes to magical creatures threatening wizards. That Mr. Hagrid had a cognitive
//deficit and couldn’t really imagine Draco and Tracey getting hurt, which was
//why Mr. Hagrid didn’t see anything wrong with leaving them alone in the
//Forbidden Forest at night. Was that not true?”

// 17552
//“It is true.”

// 17553
//“Then wouldn’t Mr. Hagrid be the worst possible teacher for Magical Creatures?”

// 17554
//The old wizard gazed down at Harry through the half-moon glasses. His voice was
//thick when he spoke. “Mr. Malfoy himself saw nothing awry. It was not so
//implausible a trick which Argus played, Harry Potter. And Rubeus might have
//grown into his position. It would have been - all Rubeus wished, his one
//greatest desire -”

// 17555
//“Your mistake,” Harry said, looking down at his knees, feeling at least ten
//percent as exhausted as he’d ever been, “is a cognitive bias we would call, in
//the trade, scope insensitivity. Failure to multiply. You’re thinking about how
//happy Mr. Hagrid would be when he heard the news. Consider the next ten years
//and a thousand students taking Magical Creatures and ten percent of them being
//scalded by Ashwinders. No one student would be hurt as much as Mr. Hagrid would
//be happy, but there’d be a hundred students being hurt and only one happy
//teacher.”

// 17556
//“Perhaps,” the old wizard said. “And your own error, Harry, is that you do not
//feel the pain of those you hurt, once you have done your multiplication.”

// 17557
//“Maybe.” Harry went on staring at his knees. “Or maybe it’s worse than that.
//Headmaster, what does it mean if a centaur doesn’t like me?” __What does
//it mean when a member of a race of magical creatures known for Divination gives
//you a lecture on people who are ignorant of consequences, apologizes, and then
//tries to stab you with a spear?__

// 17558
//“A centaur?” the Headmaster said. “When did you - ah, the Time-Turner. You are
//the reason why I could not travel back to before the event, on pain of
//paradox.”

// 17559
//“Am I? I guess I am.” Harry shook his head distantly. “Sorry.”

// 17560
//“With very few exceptions,” Dumbledore said, “centaurs do not like wizards, at
//all.”

// 17561
//“This was a bit more specific than that.”

// 17562
//“What did the centaur say to you?”

// 17563
//Harry didn’t reply.

// 17564
//“Ah.” The Headmaster hesitated. “Centaurs have been wrong many times, and if
//there is anyone in the world who could confuse the stars themselves, it is
//you.”

// 17565
//Harry looked up, and saw the blue eyes once more gentle behind the half-circle
//glasses.

// 17566
//“Do not fret too much about it,” said Albus Dumbledore.
