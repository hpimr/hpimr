//== Taboo Tradeoffs, Pt 1

// 14111
//__“Hermione Granger,” Auror Komodo said in a toneless voice, “you are
//under arrest for the attempted murder of Draco Malfoy.”__

// 14112
//The words dropped into Harry’s consciousness and shattered his thoughts into a
//hundred shards of incredulity, the shock of adrenaline running into so much
//confusion that -

// 14113
//“She -” Harry said. “She - she wouldn’t - WHAT?”

// 14114
//The Aurors weren’t paying any attention to him. Komodo spoke again, still in
//that colorless voice. “Mr. Malfoy has regained consciousness in St. Mungo’s and
//named you, Hermione Granger, as his assaulter. He has repeated these
//accusations under two drops of Veritaserum. The Blood-Cooling Charm you cast
//upon Mr. Malfoy would have killed him if he had not been found and treated, and
//it must be presumed known to you that this was a fatal curse. I therefore
//arrest you upon the serious charge of attempted murder and you will be taken
//into Ministry custody to be interrogated under three drops of Veritaserum -”

// 14115
//“__Are you mad?__” the words burst out of Harry’s mouth, as he shoved
//himself up from the Ravenclaw table, an instant before Auror Butnaru’s hand
//clamped down hard upon his shoulder. Harry ignored it. “That’s __Hermione
//Granger__ you’re trying to arrest, the nicest girl in Ravenclaw, she helps
//Hufflepuffs with their homework, she’d __die__ before she tried to kill
//__anyone -__”

// 14116
//Hermione Granger’s face had crumpled. “I did it,” she whispered in a tiny
//voice. “It was me.”

// 14117
//Another huge rock fell on Harry’s thoughts and crushed their fragile order,
//bursting fragments of comprehension into dust.

// 14118
//Dumbledore’s face seemed to have aged decades over the course of seconds. “Why,
//Miss Granger?” Dumbledore said, his own voice barely above a whisper. “Why
//would you do such a thing?”

// 14119
//“I’m,” Hermione said, “I’m, I’m - sorry - I don’t know why I -” She seemed to
//collapse in on herself, her voice was formed of nothing but sobs, and the only
//words that could be made out were, “I thought - killed him - sorry -”

// 14120
//And Harry should have said something, should have done something, should have
//jumped up out of his seat and stunned all three Aurors and then gone on to some
//incredibly clever next move, but the twice-shattered fragments of his thought
//processes could yield no output. Butnaru’s hand pushed Harry gently but firmly
//back into his seat and Harry found himself __stuck__ there like he’d been
//glued, he tried to grab his wand for a __Finite__ and it wouldn’t come out
//of his pocket, the three Aurors and Dumbledore escorted Hermione out of the
//Great Hall amid a rising storm of outcries and the doors began to swing shut
//behind them - nothing made sense, it was surreal beyond all reckoning, like
//he’d been transported into an alternate universe, and then Harry’s mind flashed
//back to another day of confusion and in a moment of desperate inspiration he
//finally realized what the Weasley twins had done to Rita Skeeter, and his voice
//rose in a scream, “__HERMIONE YOU DIDN’T DO IT YOU’VE BEEN
//FALSE-MEMORY-CHARMED!”__

// 14121
//But the doors had already shut.

// 14122
//Minerva couldn’t possibly have stood still, she paced back and forth through
//the Headmaster’s office, the back of her mind half-expecting Severus or Harry
//to tell her to shut up and sit down, but neither the Potions Master or the
//Boy-Who-Lived seemed much concerned with her, both of their gazes focused on
//Albus Dumbledore where he had emerged from the Floo. There were sounds in the
//background that nobody heard. Severus seemed as passionless as ever, sitting in
//a small cushioned chair beside the Headmaster’s desk. The old wizard stood
//terrible and upright by the still-burning fireplace, robed in black like a
//starless night, radiating power and dismay. All her own thoughts were of utter
//confusion and horror. Harry Potter sat on a wooden stool with his fingers
//gripping the seat, and his eyes were fury and freezing ice.

// 14123
//At 6:33am, Quirinus Quirrell had Flooed St. Mungo’s from his office for
//immediate pickup of Draco Malfoy. Professor Quirrell had found Mr. Malfoy in
//the trophy room of Hogwarts, on the verge of death from the continuing effects
//of the Blood-Cooling Charm slowly lowering his body temperature. Professor
//Quirrell had immediately dispelled the Charm, cast stabilizing spells on Mr.
//Malfoy, and levitated him to his office to Floo him to St. Mungo’s for further
//treatment. After this, Professor Quirrell had informed the Headmaster, stating
//the facts briefly before vanishing through the Floo; the Aurors, notified by
//St. Mungo’s, had demanded his presence for questioning.

// 14124
//The clear intent of the Blood-Cooling Charm had been to kill Draco Malfoy so
//slowly that the wards of Hogwarts, set to detect sudden injury, would not
//trigger. Under interrogation, Professor Quirrell had told the Aurors that he
//had cast several tracking Charms upon Mr. Malfoy’s person in January, shortly
//after Mr. Malfoy’s return to Hogwarts from Yuletime break. Professor Quirrell
//had cast tracking Charms because he had learned of a person with a motive to
//harm Mr. Malfoy. Professor Quirrell had refused to identify this person. The
//tracking Charms which Professor Quirrell had cast were triggered by Mr.
//Malfoy’s health falling below an absolute level, rather than by sudden changes,
//and had therefore alerted Professor Quirrell before Mr. Malfoy had died.

// 14125
//Two drops of Veritaserum, sufficient to prevent Mr. Malfoy from withholding any
//meliorating or moderating information in his statements, had shown that Mr.
//Malfoy had - legally under the laws of Noble Houses, illegally under the
//regulations of Hogwarts - challenged Hermione Granger to a duel. Mr. Malfoy had
//won the duel but had then, as he left, been attacked from behind by Miss
//Granger with a Stunning Hex. After this Mr. Malfoy knew nothing.

// 14126
//Three drops of Veritaserum, requiring her to volunteer all relevant
//information, had caused Hermione Granger to confess that she had stunned Draco
//Malfoy from behind, and then, in a fit of anger, cast the Blood-Cooling Charm
//on him, with the deliberate intention of killing him slowly enough to evade
//identification from the Hogwarts wards, whose workings she had read about in
//__Hogwarts: A History__. She had been horrified at herself upon awakening
//the next morning, but had not told anyone of what she’d done, believing Draco
//Malfoy to be already dead - as he certainly would have been after seven hours,
//had his body’s own magic not been resisting the effects of the Blood-Cooling
//Charm.

// 14127
//“Her trial,” said Albus Dumbledore, “is set for tomorrow at noon.”

// 14128
//“__What?__” the word burst out of Harry Potter. The Boy-Who-Lived didn’t
//rise from his chair, but Minerva saw his fingers whiten where they gripped the
//wooden seat beneath him. “That’s insane! You can’t do a police investigation in
//one day -”

// 14129
//The Potions Master raised his voice. “This is not __Muggle__ Britain, Mr.
//Potter!” Severus’s face was as expressionless as ever, but the bite in his
//voice was sharp. “The Aurors have an accusation under Veritaserum and a
//confession under Veritaserum. So far as they are concerned, the investigation
//is __done__.”

// 14130
//“Not quite,” said Dumbledore, just as Harry seemed ready to explode. “I have
//insisted to Amelia that this matter be given the utmost scrutiny.
//Unfortunately, as the ill-fated duel was at midnight -”

// 14131
//“__Supposed__ duel,” Harry said sharply.

// 14132
//“As the __supposed__ duel was at midnight - yes, you’re quite right, Harry
//- it is beyond the range of any Time-Turner -”

// 14133
//“Also __supposedly__,” the Boy-Who-Lived said coldly. “And rather
//__suspiciously__, since the alleged murder suspect doesn’t know about
//Time-Turners. I hope that an invisible Auror was immediately sent back in time
//as far as possible to observe -”

// 14134
//Dumbledore inclined his head. “I went __myself,__ Harry, the moment I
//heard. But by the time I reached the trophy room, Mr. Malfoy was already
//unconscious and Miss Granger had gone -”

// 14135
//“No,” said Harry Potter. “You reached the trophy room and saw Draco
//unconscious. That is all you observed, Headmaster. You did not __observe__
//Hermione there, or watch her leave. Let us distinguish observation from
//inference.” The boy’s head turned to look at her. “Imperius, Obliviation, False
//Memory Charm, Legilimency. Professor McGonagall, am I leaving out any
//mind-affecting spell that could have made Hermione do this or make her believe
//she’d done it?”

// 14136
//“The Confundus Charm,” she said. And the Dark Arts had never been her study,
//but she knew - “And certain Dark rituals. But none of those could be performed
//in Hogwarts without alarm.”

// 14137
//The boy nodded, his eyes still directly addressing her. “Which of those spells
//can be detected? Which would the Aurors try to detect?”

// 14138
//“The Confundus Charm would wear off in a few hours,” she said, after a moment
//to gather her thoughts. “Miss Granger would remember the Imperius. Obliviation
//cannot be detected by any known means, but only a Professor could have cast
//that spell upon a student without alarm from the Hogwarts wards. Legilimency -
//can only be detected by another Legilimens, I think -”

// 14139
//“I requested that Miss Granger be examined by the court Legilimens,” said
//Dumbledore. “The examination showed -”

// 14140
//“Do we trust him?” said Harry.

// 14141
//“Her,” said Dumbledore. “Sophie McJorgenson, whom I remember as an honest
//student of Ravenclaw, and she is bound by the Unbreakable Vow to tell the truth
//of what she sees -”

// 14142
//“Could someone else be Polyjuiced as her?” Harry Potter interrupted again.
//“What did you __observe,__ Headmaster?”

// 14143
//Albus said heavily, “A person who looked like Madam McJorgenson told us that a
//single Legilimens had lightly touched Miss Granger’s mind some months ago. That
//is from January, Harry, when I communicated with Miss Granger about the matter
//of a certain Dementor. That was expected; but what I did not expect was the
//rest of what Sophie found.” The old wizard turned to gaze into the Floo fire,
//letting the orange flames reflect on his face. “As you say, Harry, a False
//Memory Charm is one possibility; they are, when cast perfectly,
//indistinguishable from true memory -”

// 14144
//“That doesn’t surprise me,” Harry interrupted. “Studies show that human
//memories are more or less rewritten every time we remember them -”

// 14145
//“Harry,” Minerva said softly, and the boy’s mouth clamped shut.

// 14146
//The old wizard continued. “- but a False Memory Charm of such quality requires
//as much time to create as a true memory. Creating a detailed memory of ten
//minutes would be ten minutes’ work. And according to the court Legilimens,”
//Albus’s face now seemed more tired and lined than before, “Miss Granger has
//been obsessing over Mr. Malfoy since the day that Severus… yelled at her. She
//has been thinking of how Mr. Malfoy might be in league with Professor Snape,
//how he might be planning to harm her and harm Harry - imagining it for hours
//every day - it would be impossible to create false memories for so much time.”

// 14147
//“The appearance of insanity…” Severus murmured softly, as though he were
//speaking to himself. “__Could__ it be natural? No, it is too disastrous to
//be pure accident; too convenient for __someone,__ I have no doubt. A
//Muggle drug, perhaps? But that would not be enough - Miss Granger’s madness
//would have to be __guided __-”

// 14148
//“Ah!” Harry said suddenly. “I get it now. The __first__ False Memory Charm
//was cast on Hermione after Professor Snape yelled at her, and showed, say,
//Draco and Professor Snape plotting to kill her. Then last night that False
//Memory was __removed__ by Obliviation, leaving behind the memories of her
//obsessing about Draco for no apparent reason, at the same time she and Draco
//were given false memories of the duel.”

// 14149
//Minerva blinked in startlement. It would have been a thousand years before she
//thought of that possibility.

// 14150
//The Potions Master was frowning thoughtfully, eyes intent. “The
//__reaction__ to a False Memory Charm is hard to predict in advance, Mr.
//Potter, without Legilimency. The subjects do not always act as expected, when
//they first remember the false memories. It would have been a risky ploy. But I
//suppose that is one way Professor Quirrell could have done it.”

// 14151
//“__Professor Quirrell?__” said Harry. “What motive does __he__ have
//to -”

// 14152
//The Potions Master said dryly, “The Defense Professor is always a suspect, Mr.
//Potter. You will notice a trend, given time.”

// 14153
//Albus raised up a hand, a silencing gesture, and their heads all turned to look
//at him. “But in this case there is another suspect,” Albus said quietly.
//“Voldemort.”

// 14154
//That deadliest of unspeakable words seemed to echo around the room, canceling
//all the heat from the orange flames of the fireplace.

// 14155
//“I do not know,” the old wizard said slowly, “I know all too little, of the
//methods of Voldemort’s immortality. He searched out those books before I did, I
//think. All I could find were ancient tales, scattered across too many volumes
//for him to remove. But to find truth among many stories is also a wizard’s
//mastery, and this I have endeavored to do. There is a human sacrifice, a
//murder, of that I am certain; committed in coldest blood, the victim dying in
//horror. And old, old tales of wizards possessed, doing mad deeds, claiming the
//names of Dark Lords thought defeated; and there is usually a device, of that
//Dark Lord, which they wield…” Albus looked at Harry, the ancient eyes searching
//the younger. “I think, Harry - though you will call it only inference - that
//the act of murder splits the soul. That by ritual of blackest horror, the torn
//fragment of soul is chained to this world. To a material thing of this world.
//Which must be, or which then becomes, a device of power.”

// 14156
//__Horcrux.__ The terrible name echoed in Minerva’s mind, though it seemed
//that - for what reason she did not know - Albus would not speak that word in
//front of Harry.

// 14157
//“And therefore,” the old wizard finished quietly, “the remainder of the soul is
//bound to its chained part, lingering here when its body is destroyed. A sad and
//painful existence, I think it would be; less than spirit, less than the meanest
//ghost…” The old wizard’s eyes were locked on Harry, who gazed back with his
//eyes narrowed. “It would take time for that mutilated soul to regain a mockery
//of life. That is why we have had our ten-year reprieve, I believe; why
//Voldemort did not return at once. But in time… that revenant would become
//capable of rising again.” The old wizard spoke with grim precision. “It is
//clear, from the stories, that the Dark Lords who return by possessing another’s
//form, wield lesser magics than they once knew. I do not think Voldemort would
//be satisfied with that. He would take some other avenue to life. But Voldemort
//was more Slytherin than Salazar, grasping at every opportunity. He would
//__use__ his pitiful state, __use__ his power of possession, if he had
//reason. If he could benefit by another’s… inexplicable fury.” Albus’s voice had
//fallen to almost a whisper. “That is what I suspect happened to Miss Granger.”

// 14158
//Minerva’s throat was very dry. “He’s __here,__” she gasped.
//”__Here,__ in __Hogwarts__ -”

// 14159
//Then she stopped, because the __reason__ Voldemort had come to Hogwarts -

// 14160
//The old wizard glanced at her only briefly, and said, still in that whisper, “I
//am sorry, Minerva, you were right.”

// 14161
//Harry’s voice was edged. “Right about what?”

// 14162
//“Voldemort’s strongest avenue to life,” Dumbledore said heavily. “The most
//desirable road for him, by which he would rise greater and more terrible than
//ever before. It is guarded here, within this castle -”

// 14163
//“Excuse me,” Harry said politely. “Are you stupid?”

// 14164
//“Harry,” she said, but there was no force in her voice.

// 14165
//“I mean, maybe you haven’t noticed this, Headmaster Dumbledore, but this castle
//is full of __CHILDREN -__”

// 14166
//“__I had no choice!__” bellowed Dumbledore. The blue eyes were blazing
//now, beneath the half-moon spectacles. “I do not __own__ it, that thing
//which Voldemort desires. It belongs to another, and is held here by
//__his__ consent! I __asked__ if it could be kept in the Department of
//Mysteries. But __he__ would not permit that - he said it must be within
//the wards of Hogwarts, in the place of the Founders’ protection -” Dumbledore
//passed his hand across his forehead. “No,” the old wizard said in a quieter
//voice. “I cannot pass this blame to him. He is right. There is too much power
//in that thing, too much that men desire. I agreed that the trap should be laid
//behind the wards of Hogwarts, in the place of my own power.” The old wizard
//bowed his head. “I knew Voldemort would worm his way here somehow, and planned
//to trap him. I did not think - I did not dream - that he would tarry in an
//enemy fortress one minute longer than he must.”

// 14167
//“But,” said Severus in some puzzlement, “what would the Dark Lord possibly gain
//by killing Lucius’s only heir?”

// 14168
//“Point of order,” Harry Potter said, a hard edge in his voice. “The motives of
//whoever’s behind this are not the primary issue. Our top priority at this point
//is that an innocent Hogwarts student is in __trouble!__”

// 14169
//The green eyes locked with the blue, as Albus Dumbledore gazed back at the
//Boy-Who-Lived -

// 14170
//“Quite right, Mr. Potter,” Minerva said, she hadn’t even thought about it, the
//words just seemed to pop out of her lips. “Albus, who is watching over Miss
//Granger now?”

// 14171
//“Professor Flitwick has gone to her,” the Headmaster said.

// 14172
//“She needs a __lawyer,__” Harry said. “Anyone who just blurts out ‘I did
//it’ to the police -”

// 14173
//“Unfortunately,” Minerva said, her tone taking on some of Professor
//McGonagall’s sternness without thinking, “I doubt an attorney will be any use
//to Miss Granger at this point, Mr. Potter. She is to face the judgment of the
//Wizengamot, and they would be exceedingly unlikely to free her on a
//technicality.”

// 14174
//Harry was looking at her with an utterly incredulous expression, as though
//suggesting that Hermione Granger didn’t need an attorney was akin to suggesting
//that she be set on fire.

// 14175
//“She is correct, Mr. Potter,” Severus said quietly. “Few court processes in
//this country involve solicitors.”

// 14176
//Harry lifted his glasses and rubbed his eyes, briefly. “Fine. How do we get
//Hermione off the hook, exactly? I suppose it’s too much to hope that with all
//the lawyers gone, the judges understand the concept of ‘common sense’ and
//‘prior probability’ well enough to realize that twelve-year-old girls basically
//never commit cold-blooded murders?”

// 14177
//“It is the Wizengamot that she faces,” said Severus. “The oldest Noble Houses,
//and certain other wizards of influence.” Severus’s face twisted in something
//approaching his customary sarcasm. “As for them showing common sense - you
//might as well expect them to make you a bacon sandwich, Potter.”

// 14178
//Harry nodded, his mouth set. “Exactly what sort of penalty is Hermione facing?
//Snapped wand and expulsion -”

// 14179
//“No,” Severus said. “Nothing that light. Are you willfully misunderstanding,
//Potter? She is facing the __Wizengamot__. There is no set penalty. There
//is only the vote.”

// 14180
//Harry Potter murmured, “__The rule of law, in complex times, has proved
//itself deficient; we much prefer the rule of men, it’s vastly more efficient…__
//There’s no constraining legal rules at all, then?”

// 14181
//Light glinted off the old wizard’s half-moon glasses; he spoke carefully, and
//not without anger. “Legally, Harry, we are dealing with a blood debt from
//Hermione Granger to the House of Malfoy. The Lord of Malfoy proposes a
//repayment of that debt, and then the Wizengamot votes on his proposal. That is
//all.”

// 14182
//“But…” Harry said slowly. “Lucius was Sorted into Slytherin, he’s __got__
//to realize that Hermione was just a pawn. Not the one he should actually be
//angry at. Right?”

// 14183
//“No, Harry Potter,” Albus Dumbledore said heavily. “That is how you
//__wish__ Lucius Malfoy would think. Lucius Malfoy himself… will not share
//your desire that he think that way.”

// 14184
//Harry gazed at the Headmaster, his eyes growing colder, at the same time that
//Minerva herself had to clamp down harder on her own emotions, stop her pacing
//and try to breathe. She’d been trying not to think about it, trying to turn her
//thoughts away from it, but she knew. She’d known since the instant she’d heard.
//She could see it in Albus’s eyes -

// 14185
//“Is she facing capital punishment?” Harry said quietly, and chills went all the
//way down Minerva’s spine at the undertones of that voice.

// 14186
//“No!” Albus said. “No, not the Kiss, not Azkaban, not for a first-year in
//Hogwarts. Our country is not so lost, not yet.”

// 14187
//“But Lucius Malfoy,” Severus said tonelessly, “certainly will not be satisfied
//with only snapping her wand.”

// 14188
//“All right,” Harry said commandingly. “As I see it, we’ve got two essential
//lines of attack. Line one, find the real culprit. Line two, other leverage over
//Lucius. Professor Quirrell saved Draco’s life, does that create a blood debt
//from House Malfoy to him that he could redeem to cancel Hermione’s?”

// 14189
//Minerva blinked in startlement again.

// 14190
//“No,” Dumbledore said. The old wizard shook his head. “It was a clever thought
//- but no, Harry, I’m afraid not. There is an exception when the Wizengamot
//suspects that the circumstances of a life-debt may have been created
//deliberately. And the Defense Professor is hardly above suspicion. Thus Lucius
//would argue.”

// 14191
//Harry nodded once, face set. “Headmaster, I know I said I wouldn’t - but under
//the circumstances - that time Draco cast that torture hex on me, is that debt
//enough -”

// 14192
//“No,” the old wizard said (even as she blurted “__What?__” and Severus
//lifted an eyebrow). “It would not have been enough, and now it is no debt at
//all. You are an Occlumens and cannot testify under Veritaserum. Draco Malfoy
//could be Obliviated of his own memory before he could testify -” Albus
//hesitated. “Harry… whatever you have done with Draco, you must assume that
//Lucius Malfoy will soon know of it.”

// 14193
//Harry’s head sank into his hands. “He’ll give Draco Veritaserum.”

// 14194
//“Yes,” Albus said quietly.

// 14195
//The Boy-Who-Lived didn’t say anything, as he sat with his head in his hands.

// 14196
//The Potions Master looked genuinely shocked. “Draco really __was__ trying
//to help Miss Granger,” Severus said. “You - Potter, you __actually -__”

// 14197
//“Turned him?” Harry said from between his hands. “I was about three-quarters
//done. Taught him the Patronus Charm and everything. I don’t know what will
//happen now, though.”

// 14198
//“Voldemort has struck a grave blow against us, this day,” Albus said. The sound
//of old wizard’s voice was like the look of the boy with his head in his hands.
//“He has taken two of our pieces, with one… No. I should have seen it earlier.
//He has taken two of __Harry’s__ pieces with one move. Voldemort has begun
//his game again, not against myself, but against __Harry__. Voldemort knows
//the prophecy, he knows who his last foe shall be. He is not waiting to face
//Hermione Granger and Draco Malfoy at Harry’s side when they are grown. He is
//striking at them __now__.”

// 14199
//“Maybe it’s You-Know-Who and maybe it isn’t,” Harry said, his voice sounding a
//little unsteady. “Let’s not narrow down the hypothesis space prematurely.”
//Harry took a breath and lowered his hands. “The other thing we can try is to
//nail the real culprit before the trial - or at least find solid evidence that
//__someone__ else did it.”

// 14200
//“Mr. Potter,” said Minerva, “Professor Quirrell told the Aurors that he knew of
//someone with a motive to harm Mr. Malfoy. Do __you__ know who he was
//talking about?”

// 14201
//“Yes,” Harry said, after a hesitation. “But I think I shall conduct that part
//of my investigation with the Defense Professor - just as I would not have
//Professor Quirrell in the room while we were discussing how to investigate
//__him.__”

// 14202
//“He suspects me?” Severus said, then gave a short laugh. “Why, of course he
//does.”

// 14203
//“My own plan,” said Harry, “is to go look at the trophy room where the supposed
//duel took place and see if I can discover anything anomalous. If you can tell
//the investigating Aurors to let me through -”

// 14204
//“What investigating Aurors?” Severus said tonelessly.

// 14205
//Harry Potter took a deep breath, slowly let it out, and then spoke again. “In
//mystery books it usually takes longer than one day to solve a crime, but
//twenty-four hours is - no, __thirty __hours is eighteen hundred minutes.
//And I can think of at least one other important place to look for clues -
//though it’ll have to be someone who can get into the Ravenclaw girls’ dorm.
//Back when Hermione was fighting bullies, she was finding notes under her pillow
//each morning, telling her where to go -”

// 14206
//“__Albus…__” ground out Minerva.

// 14207
//“I did not send them,” said the old wizard. His white eyebrows had lifted in
//surprise. “I knew nothing of this. You think she was being played, Harry?”

// 14208
//“It’s a possibility,” Harry said. “More so, because there’s a part of this
//puzzle that you don’t know about yet.” Harry’s voice lowered, grew more
//intense. “Headmaster, you already know that I got my father’s invisibility
//cloak from someone who left a note under my pillow, saying it was an early
//Christmas present. I think we have to assume that’s the same person who left
//notes for Hermione -”

// 14209
//“Harry,” the old wizard said, and hesitated momentarily. “Returning your
//father’s cloak to you, does not seem to me like the act of a villain -”

// 14210
//“__Listen__,” Harry Potter said urgently. “The part you __don’t__
//know is that after Bellatrix Black escaped from Azkaban, I found another note
//under my pillow, signed ‘Santa Claus’, saying that they’d heard you were
//shutting me up inside Hogwarts, and that they were giving me an escape route to
//the Salem Witches’ Institute in America. That note came with a deck of cards,
//in which the King of Hearts was supposedly a portkey -”

// 14211
//“__Mr. Potter!__” cried Professor McGonagall, she hadn’t even thought
//before she spoke. “That could well be a __kidnapping attempt!__ You should
//have told - ”

// 14212
//“__Yes__, Professor, I did the sensible thing,” the boy said levelly. “As
//__adapted to the circumstances__, I did the sensible thing. I told
//Professor Quirrell. And according to Professor Quirrell, that portkey goes to
//somewhere in London - it’s definitely not strong enough to be an international
//portkey. Now it’s __possible__ that the person who sent the note is
//honest, and that the point in London is just a way station.” The boy reached
//into his robes and took out a deck of cards, along with a folded paper note. “I
//will trust you __not__ to go in guns blazing - I mean wands blazing - just
//in case the sender is an ally of mine, if not yours. But if this is a trap, I
//say we spring it __now__. And whoever it is, take them __alive__ so
//we can exhibit them before the Wizengamot, I cannot overemphasize that part.”

// 14213
//Severus rose from his chair, his eyes now intent, and moved toward Harry. “I’ll
//need a hair of yours for Polyjuice, Mr. Potter -”

// 14214
//“Let us not be hasty!” said Albus. “We have not yet examined the notes sent to
//Miss Granger; there may be no resemblance after all. Severus, would you enter
//her dorm room and see if you can find those?”

// 14215
//Harry Potter’s eyebrows had raised, even as he stood to offer the Potions
//Master better access to his mess of hair. “You think two __different__
//people are running around Hogwarts leaving notes beneath pillows?”

// 14216
//Severus gave a brief sardonic laugh, as his hand moved forward and plucked a
//hair, which soon was being carefully wrapped in silk. “Quite possibly. If I
//have learned anything in my tenure as Head of Slytherin, I have learned what
//ridiculous messes arise when there is more than one plotter and more than one
//plan. But Headmaster - I think Mr. Potter is correct that I should follow this
//portkey and see where it leads.”

// 14217
//Albus hesitated, and then nodded reluctantly. “I will speak to you before you
//go, then.”

// 14218
//Even as Harry Potter left the room for his own investigations, Severus spun on
//his heel and strode swiftly toward the jar of Floo powder, his cloak rising
//behind him with his speed. “I’ll get some raw Polyjuice, add the hair, and go.
//Headmaster, will you stand by to -”

// 14219
//“Albus,” Minerva said, surprised at how steady her own voice was, “did you
//leave those notes under Mr. Potter’s pillow?”

// 14220
//Severus’s hand halted an instant before casting Floo powder into the fire.

// 14221
//Dumbledore nodded to her, though the accompanying smile seemed a bit hollow.
//“You know me far too well, my dear.”

// 14222
//“And I suppose the portkey goes to a friendly home where Mr. Potter would be
//kept safe and sound until you arrived to pick him up and return him to
//Hogwarts?” Her voice tight - it was sensible, she could not deny it was
//sensible, but somehow it seemed a little cruel.

// 14223
//“It would depend on the circumstances,” the old wizard said quietly. “If Harry
//had gone so far - I might have let him make good his escape, for a time. Better
//to know where he was going, and ensure it was somewhere safe, with friends -”

// 14224
//“And to think,” said Professor McGonagall, “that I had thought to reprimand Mr.
//Potter for not telling us about this important matter! Upbraid him for not
//having the sense to trust us!” Her voice had risen in volume. “I shall skip
//that lecture, I suppose!”

// 14225
//Severus was gazing at the Headmaster with narrowed eyes. “And the notes to Miss
//Granger -”

// 14226
//“The Defense Professor, very likely,” the old wizard said. “Still - that is
//only a guess.”

// 14227
//“I shall go look for them,” Severus said. “And then, I suppose, start looking
//for You-Know-Who.” A frown crossed the Potions Master’s face. “A task at which
//I haven’t the faintest idea of where to start. Do you know of any magics to
//find a soul, Headmaster?”

// 14228
//The Divination classroom was lit by the dim red light of a hundred small fires
//where burned a hundred kinds of incense, so that if you were to ask in one word
//what the room looked like, the answer would be ‘smoke’. (Assuming you bothered
//to look at anything, when your nose was threatening to overload and die.) If
//your gaze could pierce those dank mists, you would see a tiny, cluttered room
//in which forty stuffed armchairs, most of them unused, were crammed around a
//small open space in the center of the room, where a circular trapdoor waited on
//your escape.

// 14229
//“The grim!” Professor Trelawney said in a quavering voice, as she peered into
//George Weasley’s teacup. “The grim! It is a sign of death! One whom you know,
//George - someone you know is to die! And soon - yes, it shall be quite soon, I
//think - unless of course it is later -”

// 14230
//It would have been a good deal scarier, thought Fred and George, if she hadn’t
//said the same thing to every single other student in their Divination class.
//They were hardly even thinking about it at this point; all their thoughts were
//on today’s disaster -

// 14231
//The trapdoor in the floor flew open with a bang that caused Professor Trelawney
//to shriek and spill George’s tea all over his robes, and then an instant later
//Dumbledore was whooshing up out of the floor with a bird of fire upon his
//shoulder.

// 14232
//“Fred!” the old wizard said commandingly. His robes were the black of a
//moonless night, his eyes hard like blue diamonds. “George! With me, now!”

// 14233
//There was an collective gasp and by the time Fred and George were climbing down
//the ladder after the Headmaster, the entire class was already speculating what
//role they’d played in the attempted murder of Draco Malfoy.

// 14234
//The trapdoor had hardly slammed shut above them before all nearby sounds muted
//and the old wizard spun on them and held out a hand and commanded, “Give me the
//map!”

// 14235
//“M-map?” said Fred or George in total shock. They’d never even suspected that
//Dumbledore suspected. “Why, w-we don’t know what you’re -”

// 14236
//“Hermione Granger is in trouble,” said the old wizard.

// 14237
//“The Map is in our dorm,” George or Fred said immediately. “Just give us a few
//minutes to get it and we’ll -”

// 14238
//The wizard’s arms swept them up as if they were hugging-pillows, there was a
//piercing cry and a flash of fire and then the three of them were in the
//third-year Gryffindor’s boys’ dorm.

// 14239
//A few moments later, Fred and George were handing over the Map to the
//Headmaster, wincing only slightly at the sacrilege of giving their precious
//piece of the Hogwarts security system to the person who actually owned it, and
//the old wizard was frowning at the apparent blankness.

// 14240
//“You’ve got to say,” they explained, “__I solemnly swear that I am up to
//no good -__”

// 14241
//“I decline to lie,” said the old wizard. He held the Map high and bellowed,
//“Hear me, Hogwarts! __Deligitor prodi!__” An instant later the Headmaster
//was wearing the Sorting Hat, which looked __scarily right__ upon his head,
//as though Dumbledore had always been waiting for a patchwork pointed hat to
//complete his existence.

// 14242
//(Fred and George immediately memorized this phrase, just in case it would work
//for somebody besides the Headmaster, and began trying to think of pranks that
//would involve the Sorting Hat.)

// 14243
//The old wizard wasted not a moment before sweeping the Sorting Hat off his head
//and turning it upside-down - it was hard to tell with the Hat upside-down, but
//it looked a bit cross at the treatment - and then plunged in his hand and drew
//out a crystal rod. With this instrument he began tracing rune-like patterns on
//the Map, muttering strange incantations that sounded not quite like Latin and
//echoed in their ears in an unusually creepy fashion. In the midst of tracing
//one rune he looked up at both of them, fixing them with a sharp glare. “I will
//return this to you later, sons of Weasley. Go back to class.”

// 14244
//“Yes, Headmaster,” they said, and hesitated. “Ah - about Hermione Granger, is
//she really going to be bound to serve Draco Malfoy forever as his -”

// 14245
//“__Go,__” said the old wizard.

// 14246
//They went.

// 14247
//When he was alone in the room, the old wizard looked down at the map, which had
//now written upon itself a fine line drawing of the Gryffindor dorms in which
//they stood, the small handwritten __Albus P.W.B. Dumbledore__ the only
//name left therein.

// 14248
//The old wizard smoothed the map, bent over it, and whispered, “Find Tom
//Riddle.”

// 14249
//The interrogation room at the Department of Magical Law Enforcement was usually
//lit by a small orange light, so that the Auror interrogating you would be
//leaning toward your uncomfortable metal chair with most of their face in
//shadow, preventing you from reading their expression, even as they read yours.

// 14250
//As soon as Mr. Quirrell had entered the room, the small orange light had dimmed
//and begun flickering like a candle about to be blown out by the wind. The room
//was now lit by a sourceless ice-colored glow which illuminated all of Mr.
//Quirrell’s pale skin like alabaster, except, somehow, his eyes, which stayed in
//darkness.

// 14251
//The Auror on duty outside had surreptitiously tried to dispel this effect four
//times without the slightest success, despite the fact that Mr. Quirrell had
//politely surrendered his wand upon being detained for interrogation, and had
//shown no sign of speaking any incantations nor exerting any other power.

// 14252
//“Quirinus… Quirrell,” drawled the man now sitting across from where the Defense
//Professor had waited courteously. The interrogator had tawny hair that swept
//back like a lion’s mane, with yellowish eyes set into the sternly lined face of
//a man late in his tenth decade. The man was, at this moment, leafing through a
//large folder of parchments that he had taken from a black and very
//solid-looking briefcase after he had limped into the room and sat down, seeming
//not to look at the face of the man he was interrogating. He had not introduced
//himself.

// 14253
//After some further leafing through parchments, carried out in silence, the
//Auror spoke again. “Born the 26th of September, 1955, to Quondia Quirrell, of
//an acknowledged tryst with Lirinus Lumblung…” intoned the Auror. “Sorted into
//Ravenclaw… O.W.L.S. quite good… N.E.W.T.S. in Charms, Transfiguration… an
//Outstanding in Muggle Studies, impressive… Ancient Runes, and ah yes, Defense.
//An Outstanding in that as well. Went on to become quite the tourist, visiting
//all sorts of places. Portkey visas for Transylvania, the Forbidden Empire, the
//City of Endless Night… my my, __Texas__.” The man looked up from the
//portfolio, eyes narrowed. “What were you doing __there__, Mr. Quirrell?”

// 14254
//“Sightseeing, mostly in the Muggle areas,” the Defense Professor said easily.
//“As you say, I am quite the tourist.”

// 14255
//The man listened to this with a frown, then looked back down, then up again. “I
//also see that you visited Fuyuki City in 1983.”

// 14256
//The Defense Professor lifted an eyebrow in mild puzzlement. “What of it?”

// 14257
//“What did you do in Fuyuki City?” The question snapped out razor-sharp.

// 14258
//The Defense Professor frowned slightly. “Nothing of any account. I visited some
//better-known sights, some less-known sights, and aside from that, kept to
//myself.”

// 14259
//“Really?” the Auror said softly. “I find that reply rather interesting.”

// 14260
//“How so?” said the Defense Professor.

// 14261
//“Because there was no visa listed for Fuyuki City.” The man slammed the folder
//shut. “You’re not Quirinus Quirrell. Who the __hell__ are you?”

// 14262
//The Potions Master walked quietly into the Ravenclaw girls’ dorm, the
//first-year dorm room, a festive place where bronze and blue competed to be the
//color of stuffed animals, scarves and dresses, small bits of inexpensive
//jewelry, and posters of famous people. Hermione Granger’s bed was easy to
//identify; it was the one that had been attacked by a book monster.

// 14263
//Nobody else seemed to be around, at that time of day, and a number of spells
//verified this.

// 14264
//The Potions Master searched under Hermione Granger’s pillow, and beneath her
//bed, and then began going through her trunk, sorting through mentionable and
//unmentionable items without change of expression, and finally succeeded in
//drawing forth a set of papers describing places and times where bullies would
//be found, all of the papers signed only with an elaborate ‘S’.

// 14265
//A brief burst of fire later, the papers were gone, and the Potions Master left
//to report the failure of his mission.

// 14266
//The Defense Professor was sitting calmly with his hands still folded in his
//lap. “If you consult Headmaster Dumbledore,” said the Defense Professor, “you
//will find that he is well aware of this matter, and that I agreed to teach his
//Defense class on the explicit condition that no inquiry be made into my -”

// 14267
//In a lightning motion, the interrogator whipped out his wand and spat
//“__Polyfluis Reverso!__” at the same time that the Defense Professor
//sneezed, which somehow caused the mirror-silvered ray to disrupt in a shower of
//white sparks.

// 14268
//“Pardon me,” the Defense Professor said politely.

// 14269
//The smile that the Auror gave had absolutely no mirth in it. “So where’s the
//real Quirinus Quirrell, eh? Under an Imperius in the bottom of a trunk
//somewhere, while you take a hair now and then for your illegal Polyjuice?”

// 14270
//“You are making highly questionable assumptions,” the Defense Professor said
//with an edged voice. “What makes you think I did not steal his body outright
//using incredibly Dark magic?”

// 14271
//This was followed by a certain pause.

// 14272
//“I suggest,” the Auror said, “that you take this seriously, Mr.
//Whoever-You-Are.”

// 14273
//“I’m sorry,” said the Defense Professor, leaning back in his chair, “but I see
//little reason to humble myself on this particular occasion. What are you going
//to do, kill me?”

// 14274
//“I don’t appreciate your humor,” the Auror said softly.

// 14275
//“How unfortunate for you, Rufus Scrimgeour,” said the Defense Professor. “You
//have my deepest sympathy.” He tilted his head, seeming to study the
//interrogator; and even within the shadow of the ice-light, the eyes glinted.

// 14276
//Padma stared down at her plate.

// 14277
//“Hermione wouldn’t just __do__ that!” yelled Mandy Brocklehurst, who was
//practically in tears, in fact she __was__ in tears, her voice would have
//been loud enough to silence the Great Hall if it hadn’t been for all the other
//students also screaming at each other. “I - I bet Malfoy tried to - to
//__do__ things to her -”

// 14278
//“Our General would __never__ do that!” Kevin Entwhistle yelled even louder
//than Mandy.

// 14279
//“Of course he would!” shouted Anthony Goldstein. “Malfoy’s the son of a
//__Death Eater!__”

// 14280
//Padma stared down at her plate.

// 14281
//Draco was the General of her army.

// 14282
//Hermione was the founder of S.P.H.E.W.

// 14283
//Draco had trusted her to be his second-in-command.

// 14284
//Hermione was her fellow Ravenclaw.

// 14285
//Both of them were her friends, maybe the two best friends she had.

// 14286
//Padma stared down at her plate. She was glad the Sorting Hat hadn’t offered her
//Hufflepuff. If she’d been Sorted into Hufflepuff it would probably have been
//much more painful, trying to decide where her divided loyalties lay…

// 14287
//She blinked and realized that her vision had gotten blurry again, and raised a
//trembling hand to wipe once more at her eyes.

// 14288
//Morag MacDougal snorted so loudly it was audible even amid the pandemonium of
//lunch, and said in a loud voice, “I bet Granger __cheated__ in her battle
//yesterday, I bet that’s why Malfoy challenged her __-__”

// 14289
//“All of you __SHUT UP!__” roared Harry Potter, as he hit the table with
//his fists so hard that plates rattled all the way along it.

// 14290
//At any other time it would have gotten Professors reprimanding him, this time
//it just got a few nearby students to look.

// 14291
//“I’d wanted to eat lunch,” Harry Potter said, “and then get back to
//investigating, so I wasn’t going to talk. But you’re all being __silly__,
//and when the truth comes out you’re going to regret what you said about
//innocent people. Draco didn’t do anything, Hermione didn’t do anything, they
//were both False-Memory-Charmed!” Harry Potter’s voice had been rising on the
//last words. “__How is that not BLOODY OBVIOUS?__”

// 14292
//“You think we’ll believe__ that?__” Kevin Entwhistle yelled right back at
//him. “That’s what everyone says! ‘I didn’t do it, it was all just a False
//Memory Charm!’ You think we’re __stupid?__”

// 14293
//And Morag nodded right along with him, with a condescending look.

// 14294
//The look that came over Harry Potter’s face then made Padma flinch.

// 14295
//“I see,” Harry Potter said, it wasn’t a shout so Padma had to strain to hear
//it. “Professor Quirrell isn’t here to explain to me how stupid people are, but
//I bet this time I can get it on my own. People do something dumb and get caught
//and are given Veritaserum. Not romantic master criminals, because __they__
//wouldn’t get caught, __they__ would have learned Occlumency. Sad,
//pathetic, incompetent criminals get caught, and confess under Veritaserum, and
//they’re desperate to stay out of Azkaban so they say they were
//False-Memory-Charmed. Right? So your brain, by sheer Pavlovian association,
//links the idea of False Memory Charms to pathetic criminals with unbelievable
//excuses. You don’t have to consider the specific details, your brain just
//__pattern-matches__ the hypothesis into a bucket of things you don’t
//believe, and you’re done. Just like my father thought that magical hypotheses
//could never be believed, because he’d heard so many stupid people talking about
//magic. Believing a hypothesis that involves False Memory Charms is
//__low-status__.”

// 14296
//“What are you __blithering__ about?” said Morag, looking down her nose at
//the Boy-Who-Lived.

// 14297
//“You think we’d believe anything __you__ say?” yelled a slightly
//older-looking Ravenclaw witch who Padma didn’t recognize. “When __you__
//turned Granger Dark?”

// 14298
//“And I’m not going to complain,” Harry Potter said in an eerily calm voice,
//“about wizards not having any logic and believing the craziest things. Because
//I said that to Professor Quirrell once, and he just gave me this __look__
//and said that if I wasn’t blinded by my upbringing I could think of a hundred
//more ridiculous things that lots of Muggles believe. What you’re all doing is
//very human and very normal and doesn’t make you __unusually__ bad people,
//so I’m not going to complain.” The Boy-Who-Lived rose up from his bench. “I’ll
//see you all later.”

// 14299
//And Harry Potter walked away from them, walked away from all of them.

// 14300
//“You’re not thinking he’s __right,__ are you?” said Su Li from beside her,
//in a tone which made it clear what __she__ thought.

// 14301
//“I -” said Padma. Her words seemed to be caught in her throat, her thoughts
//seemed to be caught in her head. “I - I mean - I -”

// 14302
//If you think hard enough you can do the impossible.

// 14303
//(It had always been an article of faith with Harry. There’d been a time when
//he’d acknowledged the laws of physics as ultimate limitations, and now he
//suspected there were no true limits at all.)

// 14304
//If you think __fast__ enough you can sometimes do the impossible
//__quickly__…

// 14305
//…sometimes.

// 14306
//Only sometimes.

// 14307
//Not always.

// 14308
//Not __reliably__.

// 14309
//The Boy-Who-Lived stared around the trophy room, surrounded by awards and cups
//and plates and shields and statues and medals kept behind thousands, perhaps
//tens of thousands, of crystal glass displays. For as many centuries as Hogwarts
//had existed, this room had been accumulating details. A week, a month, maybe
//even a year, wouldn’t have sufficed to take the ‘examine’ option on every item
//in the room. With Professor Flitwick gone, Harry had asked Professor Vector if
//there was any way to detect damage to the wards around the crystal cases,
//verify the residue that a real duel should have left behind. Harry had raced
//through the Hogwarts library looking for spells to tell the difference between
//old fingerprints and new fingerprints, or to detect lingering exhalations in a
//room. And all those attempts at playing detective had failed.

// 14310
//There were no clues, none that he was smart enough to find.

// 14311
//Professor Snape had said that the portkey led to an empty house in London, with
//no sign of anyone or anything else.

// 14312
//Professor Snape hadn’t found any notes in Hermione’s dorm.

// 14313
//Headmaster Dumbledore had said that Voldemort’s spirit was probably hiding out
//in the Chamber of Secrets where the Hogwarts security system couldn’t find him.
//Harry had snuck into the Slytherin dungeons under the Cloak of Invisibility and
//spent the rest of the afternoon looking through all the obvious places, but he
//hadn’t found anything snaky that answered back when spoken to. The entrance to
//the Chamber of Secrets, it seemed, hadn’t been meant to be found in a day.

// 14314
//Harry had talked to all of Hermione’s friends that would still talk to him, and
//none of them had remembered Hermione saying anything specific about why she’d
//believed that Draco was plotting against her.

// 14315
//Professor Quirrell hadn’t come back from the Ministry as of dinnertime. The
//older students seemed to think that this year’s Defense Professor would
//probably end up being blamed for the incident, and fired for teaching Hogwarts
//students to be too violent. They’d talked about the Defense Professor as though
//he were already gone.

// 14316
//Harry had used up all six hours from his Time-Turner, and there were still no
//clues, and he had to go to sleep now if he wanted to be functional at
//Hermione’s trial the next day.

// 14317
//The Boy-Who-Destroyed-A-Dementor was standing in the middle of the Hogwarts
//trophy room, his wand dropped at his feet.

// 14318
//He was crying.

// 14319
//Sometimes you call your brain and it doesn’t answer.

// 14320
//The trial of Hermione Granger started on schedule the next day.
