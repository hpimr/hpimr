// 13375
//== Interlude with the Confessor: Sunk Costs

// 13376
//Rianne Felthorne descended the stairs of roughened stone and crude mortar,
//keeping a __Lumos__ lit through the distances between fire-sconces,
//holding aloft her wand through the gaps from light to light.

// 13377
//She came to the empty rock cavern pierced by many dark openings, lit by a torch
//of ancient style that fired as she entered.

// 13378
//There was no one else there, as yet, and after long minutes of nervous
//standing, she began the spell to Transfigure a cushioned sofa large enough for
//two people to sit, or maybe even lie down on. A simple wooden stool would have
//been easier, she could have done that in fifteen seconds, but - well -

// 13379
//Even when the sofa was fully conjured, Professor Snape still hadn’t arrived,
//and she sat down on the left side of her sofa with her pulse hammering in her
//throat. Somehow she was only becoming more nervous, not less, as the delay
//stretched.

// 13380
//She knew this was the last time.

// 13381
//The last time before all these memories went away, and Rianne Felthorne found
//herself in a mysterious cavern, wondering what was going on.

// 13382
//There was something about it that felt like dying.

// 13383
//The books said a properly done Obliviation wasn’t harmful, people forgot things
//all the time. People dreamed, and then woke up without remembering their
//dreams. Obliviation didn’t even involve that much discontinuity, just a brief
//instant of disorientation; it was like being distracted by a loud noise and
//losing track of a thought you couldn’t seem to remember afterward. That was
//what the books said, and why Memory Charms were fully approved by the Ministry
//for all authorized governmental purposes.

// 13384
//But still, __these thoughts,__ the thoughts she was thinking right now;
//soon nobody would have them anymore. When she looked ahead in the future, there
//was nobody to complete the thoughts she wasn’t finished thinking. Even if she
//managed to tie up all the loose ends in her mind over the next minute, there
//wouldn’t be anything left of it afterward. Wasn’t that exactly what you would
//find yourself reflecting on, if you were going to die in the next minute?

// 13385
//There came the sound of muffled steps…

// 13386
//Severus Snape emerged into the cavern.

// 13387
//His eyes moved to her sitting on the sofa, and a strange expression crossed his
//face; strange because it wasn’t sardonic, or angry, or cold.

// 13388
//“Thank you, Miss Felthorne,” Snape said quietly, “that was considerate of you.”
//The Potions Master took out his wand and performed the usual privacy Charms,
//and then he moved toward her, and sat down heavily beside her on the
//Transfigured sofa.

// 13389
//Her pulse was now pounding for another reason entirely.

// 13390
//She slowly turned to look at Professor Snape, and saw that his head was leaning
//back against the sofa, and his eyes were closed. Not sleeping, though. His face
//appeared tense, unrelaxed, bearing pain.

// 13391
//She knew - she was suddenly certain - that she was only allowed to see this
//sight because she wouldn’t remember it afterward; and that nobody before her
//had ever been allowed to see it.

// 13392
//The frantic conversation going on inside Rianne Felthorne’s mind sounded
//something like this: __I could just lean over and kiss him, you are
//completely out of your tiny mind, his eyes are closed I bet he wouldn’t stop me
//in time, I bet it would be years before anyone found your body -__

// 13393
//But Professor Snape opened his eyes then (to her inner disappointment and
//relief), and said, in a more normal voice, “Your payment, Miss Felthorne.” From
//his robe he took a ruby, cut to Gringotts standard, and held it out toward her.
//“Fifty facets. I will not mind if you count them.”

// 13394
//She held out a trembling hand, hoping that Snape would press the ruby into her
//fingers, that she would feel a touch of his skin alive against hers -

// 13395
//But instead Snape raised his hand slightly and dropped the ruby into her hand,
//then leaned back against the couch. “You will remember finding it lying on the
//ground of this cavern, where you came exploring,” said Snape. “And since nobody
//except you will actually believe that, you will remember thinking that it would
//be less troublesome if you deposited the money into a separate box in
//Gringotts.”

// 13396
//For a stretch there was only the faint crackling of the torch.

// 13397
//“Why -” Rianne Felthorne said. __He knows I won’t remember.__ “Why
//__did__ you do it? I mean - you said to tell you where bullies would be,
//and who they would be, but not whether Granger would be there. And I know, the
//way the Time-Turner works, if you want to __make__ Granger be there, you
//can’t be told whether it’s already happened. So I did work out that __we__
//were the ones telling her where to go. We were, weren’t we?”

// 13398
//Snape nodded without speaking. He had closed his eyes again.

// 13399
//“But,” said Rianne, “I didn’t understand __why__ you were helping her. And
//now - after what you did to Granger in the Great Hall - I just don’t understand
//at all.” Rianne had never thought of herself as particularly nice. She’d taken
//little notice of the controversy over the Sunshine General. But something about
//__helping__ Granger fight bullies had… well, she’d gotten used to thinking
//of that as the good side, and thinking of __herself__ as being on the good
//side. And she’d found she actually liked it. It was hard, to just let that go.
//“Why’d you do that, Professor Snape?”

// 13400
//Snape shook his head, his face tightened.

// 13401
//“Is -” Rianne said falteringly. “I mean - so long as we’re here - is there
//anything you do want to talk about?” There was something __she__ wanted to
//say, but she couldn’t make the words pass her own lips.

// 13402
//“I can think of one matter,” Snape said after a pause. “If you are interested,
//Miss Felthorne.”

// 13403
//Snape’s eyes were still shut, so she couldn’t just nod her head. Her voice
//almost broke, when she forced herself to say “Yes.”

// 13404
//“There’s a certain boy in your class who likes you, Miss Felthorne,” Snape said
//from behind his closed eyes. “I won’t say his name. But he watches you every
//time you walk across the room, when he thinks you aren’t looking. He dreams
//about you and desires to possess you, but he’s never asked you for so much as a
//kiss.”

// 13405
//Her heart started hammering even harder.

// 13406
//“Please tell me the honest truth, Miss Felthorne. What do you think of that
//boy?”

// 13407
//“Well -” she said. She was stumbling over her words. “I think - to never even
//ask for one kiss - would be -”

// 13408
//__Sad.__

// 13409
//__Just too p____itiful.__

// 13410
//“Weakness,” she said, her voice trembling.

// 13411
//“I agree,” said Snape. “Suppose that boy had helped you, though. Would you
//think that you owed him a kiss, if he asked?”

// 13412
//She inhaled sharply -

// 13413
//“Or would you think,” Snape continued, his eyes still closed, “that he was just
//being bothersome?”

// 13414
//The words stabbed into her like a knife and she couldn’t help gasping out loud.

// 13415
//Snape’s eyes flew open, and his gaze met hers across the sofa.

// 13416
//Then the Potions Master began to laugh, small sad chuckles.

// 13417
//“No, not __you,__ Miss Felthorne!” Snape said. “Not __you!__ We
//really __are__ talking about a boy. One who attends your Potions class, in
//fact.”

// 13418
//“Oh,” she said. She tried to remember what Snape had said before, now feeling
//rather unnerved as she thought of some boy watching her, always silently
//watching. “Well, um, in that case. That’s kind of __creepy__, actually.
//Who is it?”

// 13419
//The Potions Master shook his head. “It doesn’t matter,” said Snape. “Out of
//curiosity, what would you think if that boy were still in love with you years
//later?”

// 13420
//“Um,” she said, feeling a bit confused, “that would be totally pathetic?”

// 13421
//The torch crackled a bit in the cavern.

// 13422
//“It’s strange,” Snape said quietly. “I have had two mentors, over the course of
//my days. Both were extraordinarily perceptive, and neither one ever told me the
//things I wasn’t seeing. It’s clear enough why the first said nothing, but the
//second…” Snape’s face tightened. “I suppose I would have to be naive, to ask
//why he stayed silent.”

// 13423
//The quiet stretched, while Rianne tried frantically to think of something to
//say.

// 13424
//“It is an odd thing,” Snape said, his voice still softer, “to look back after
//only thirty-two years, and wonder when your life was ruined past all rescuing.
//Was it determined when the Sorting Hat cried ‘Slytherin!’ for me? It seems
//unfair, since I was offered no choice; the Sorting Hat spoke the moment it
//touched upon my head. Yet I cannot claim it named me untruly. I never treasured
//knowledge for its own sake. I was not loyal to the one person I called friend.
//I was never one for righteous fury, then or now. Courage? There is no bravery
//in risking a life already ruined. My little fears have always mastered me, and
//I never turned aside from any of the paths I walked down, for those little
//fears. No, the Sorting Hat could never have put me in her House. Perhaps my
//final loss was determined, even then. Is that fair, I ask, even if the Sorting
//Hat speaks truly? Is it fair that some children should possess more courage
//than others, and thus a man’s life be judged?”

// 13425
//Rianne Felthorne was starting to realize that she’d never had the tiniest
//inkling of who her Potions Master was inside, and unfortunately all these dark
//hidden depths weren’t helping her with her problem.

// 13426
//“But no,” Snape said. “I know where it went wrong for the last time. I could
//point to the very day and hour I missed my final chance. Miss Felthorne, did
//the Sorting Hat offer you Ravenclaw?”

// 13427
//“Y-yes,” she said without thinking.

// 13428
//“Have you ever been any good at riddles?”

// 13429
//“Yes,” she said again, because whatever Professor Snape was about to say, she
//wouldn’t hear it if she said __no.__

// 13430
//“I am terrible at riddles,” Snape said in a distant voice. “I was once given a
//riddle to solve, and I did not understand even the simplest part until too
//late. I did not even realize the riddle was meant for __me__ until too
//late. I thought I had merely happened to overhear it, when in truth it was I
//who was overheard. So I sold my riddle to another, and that is when the
//wreckage of my life passed beyond retrieval.” Snape’s voice was still distant,
//sounding more abstracted than sorrowful. “And even now, I understand nothing of
//importance. Tell me, Miss Felthorne, suppose a man were carrying a knife, and
//he tripped over a baby and stabbed himself. Would you say that the baby had,”
//Snape’s voice lowered, as though he were imitating some still deeper voice,
//“__THE POWER TO VANQUISH__ him?”

// 13431
//“Um… no?” she said hesitantly.

// 13432
//“Then what __does__ it mean to have the power to vanquish someone?”

// 13433
//Rianne considered the puzzle. (Wishing, not for the first time in her life,
//that she had chosen Ravenclaw and to perdition with her parents’ disapproval;
//but the Sorting Hat had never offered her Gryffindor.) “Well…” Rianne said. She
//was having trouble putting her thoughts into words. “It means you’ve got the
//__power__, but you don’t __have__ to do it. It means you could do it
//if you tried -”

// 13434
//“Choice,” the Potions Master said in the same faraway voice, as though he
//wasn’t really talking to her at all. “There will be a choice. That is what the
//riddle seems to imply. And that choice is not a foregone conclusion to the
//chooser, for the riddle does not say, __will vanquish,__ but rather
//__the power to vanquish.__ How would a grown man mark a baby as his
//equal?”

// 13435
//“What?” said Rianne. She didn’t understand that at all.

// 13436
//“__Marking__ a baby is simple. Any strong Dark curse would produce a
//lasting scar. But such may be done to any child. What mark would signify that a
//baby was your __equal?__”

// 13437
//She answered with the first thought that came to mind. “If you signed a
//betrothal contract, that would mean you’d be equals with them someday, when
//they grew up and you got married.”

// 13438
//“That…” said Snape. “That’s probably not it, Miss Felthorne, but thank you for
//trying.” The long delicate fingers, honed by stirring potions to unimaginably
//fine tolerances, reached up and rubbed at the temples of the man’s forehead.
//“It is enough to drive me to madness, so much hinging on such fragile words.
//Power he knows not… it __must__ be more than some unknown spell. Not
//something __he__ could acquire simply by practice and study. Some innate
//talent? No one can learn to be a Metamorphmagus… and yet that hardly seems like
//a power he __knows not__. Nor can I see how __either__ could destroy
//all but a remnant of the other; I can see it in one direction, but not the
//reverse…” The Potions Master sighed. “And none of this means anything to you,
//does it, Miss Felthorne? The words are nothing. The words are shadows. It is
//her __intonation__ which carries the meaning and that is something I’ve
//never been able to…”

// 13439
//The Potions Master trailed off, while Rianne stared at him.

// 13440
//“A __prophecy?__” Rianne said in a high squeak. “You heard a
//__prophecy?__” She’d taken Divination for a couple of months before
//dropping it in disgust, and she knew that much about how it worked.

// 13441
//“I will try one last thing,” said Snape. “Something I have not tried before.
//Miss Felthorne, listen to the __sound__ of my voice, the __way__ I
//say it__,__ not the words themselves, and tell me what you think it means.
//Can you do that? Good,” said Snape, as she nodded obediently, though she wasn’t
//sure at all what she was supposed to do.

// 13442
//And Severus Snape drew a breath, and intoned, “__FOR THOSE TWO DIFFERENT
//SPELLETS CANNOT EXIST IN THE SAME VULD.__”

// 13443
//It sent shivers down her spine, all the worse for knowing the hollow words had
//been spoken in imitation of a true prophecy. Unnerved, she blurted out the
//first thing which came to mind, which might have been influenced by her present
//company. “Those two different ingredients cannot exist in the same cauldron?”

// 13444
//“But why__ not__, Miss Felthorne? What is the __meaning__ of a
//statement like that? What are we really being told?”

// 13445
//“Ah…” she hazarded. “If the two ingredients mix, they’ll catch fire and burn
//the cauldron?”

// 13446
//Snape’s face did not change expression in the slightest.

// 13447
//“Perhaps,” Snape finally said, after they’d sat on the sofa in awful silence
//for what seemed like minutes. “It would explain the word __must__. Thank
//you, Miss Felthorne. Once again you have been most helpful.”

// 13448
//“I -” she said, “I was glad to -” and the words stuck in her throat. The
//Potions Master had thanked her with a tone of finality, and she knew that the
//time of the Rianne Felthorne who remembered these moments was drawing to an
//end. “I wish I didn’t have to forget this, Professor Snape!”

// 13449
//“I wish,” Severus Snape said in a whisper so low she could hardly hear it,
//“that everything had been different…”

// 13450
//The Potions Master stood up from the sofa, the weight of his presence vanishing
//from beside her. He turned and drew his wand from his robes, pointing it at
//her.

// 13451
//“Wait -” she said. “Before that -”

// 13452
//Somehow it was unbelievably hard to take the first step from fantasy to
//reality, from imagining to doing. Even if it was only one step and would never
//go any further. The gap stretched like the distance between two mountains.

// 13453
//The Sorting Hat had never offered her Gryffindor…

// 13454
//…was it fair that thus a woman’s life be judged?

// 13455
//__If you can’t ____say it now, when you won’t even remember it
//afterward - when nothing will continue from this moment, just as if you were to
//die - then when will you ever say it, to anyone?__

// 13456
//“Can I have a kiss first?” said Rianne Felthorne.

// 13457
//Snape’s black eyes studied her so intensely that her blush started to reach all
//the way to her chest, and she wondered if he knew perfectly well that she was
//still being weak, and it wasn’t a kiss she’d truly wanted.

// 13458
//“Why not,” the Potions Master said quietly, and he leaned his head down over
//the sofa and kissed her.

// 13459
//It was nothing like she’d imagined. In her fantasies Snape’s kisses were
//fierce, seized from her, but this was - it was just __awkward,__ actually.
//Snape’s lips pressed down too hard on hers, forcing them back against her
//teeth, and the angle wasn’t right and their noses were sort of bending and his
//lips were too __tight__ and -

// 13460
//Only as the Potions Master straightened back up again, raising his wand once
//more, did she realize.

// 13461
//“That wasn’t -” she said in a wondering voice, looking up at him. “That wasn’t
//- was it - your __first__ -”

// 13462
//Rianne Felthorne blinked at the stone cavern she’d discovered, still holding
//the extraordinary ruby she’d found embedded in the dirt of one corner. It was
//an incredible windfall, and she didn’t know why looking at the ruby made her
//feel so sad, like she’d forgotten something, something that had been precious
//to her.
