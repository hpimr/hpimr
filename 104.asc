//== The Truth, Pt 1, Riddles and Answers

// 17758
//__June 13th, 1992.__

// 17759
//It was the last week of school in Hogwarts, and Professor Quirrell was still
//alive, barely. The Defense Professor himself would be in a healer’s bed, this
//day, as he’d been for almost the last week.

// 17760
//Hogwarts tradition said that exams were given in the first week of June, that
//exam results were released the second week, and that in the third week, there
//would be the Leave-Taking Feast on Sunday and the Hogwarts Express transporting
//you to London on Monday.

// 17761
//Harry had wondered, a long time ago when he’d first read about that schedule,
//just what exactly the students did during the __rest__ of the second week
//of June, since ‘waiting for exam results’ didn’t sound like much; and the
//answer had surprised him when he’d found out.

// 17762
//But now the second week of June was done as well, and it was Saturday; there
//was nothing left of the year but the Leave-Taking Feast on the 14th and the
//Hogwarts Express ride on the 15th.

// 17763
//And nothing had been answered.

// 17764
//Nothing had been resolved.

// 17765
//Hermione’s killer hadn’t been found.

// 17766
//Somehow Harry had been thinking that, surely, all the truth would come out by
//the end of the school year; like that was the end of a mystery novel and the
//mystery’s answer had been promised him. Certainly it had to be known by the
//time the Defense Professor… died, it couldn’t be allowed for Professor Quirrell
//to __die__ without knowing the answer, without everything being neatly
//resolved. Not exam grades, certainly not death, it was only truth that finished
//a story…

// 17767
//But unless you bought Draco Malfoy’s latest theory that Professor Sprout had
//been assigning and grading less homework around the time of Hermione being
//framed for attempted murder, thereby proving that Professor Sprout had been
//spending her time setting it up, the truth remained unfound.

// 17768
//And instead, like the world had priorities that were more like other people’s
//way of thinking, the year was going to end with a climactic Quidditch match.

***

// 17769
//In the air above the stadium, distant figures on broomsticks swooped and
//pirouetted and spun around each other. The red-purplish truncated tetrahedron
//that was the Quaffle was caught, tossed, blocked, and occasionally thrown
//through floating hoops, accompanied by stadium-rocking cries of triumph or
//dismay. Blue and green and yellow and red-trimmed robes shouted with the
//enthusiasm that people felt so easily when no action would be required from
//them personally.

// 17770
//It was the first Quidditch match Harry had attended at Hogwarts, and he’d
//already decided that it would be the last.

// 17771
//“Davies has the Quaffle!” shouted the amplified voice of Lee Jordan. “That’s
//another ten points for Ravenclaw in seven… six… five… holy smokes, he’s done it
//already! Smack through the center of the central hoop! I’ve never seen such a
//winning streak - I’m calling it right now for Davies becoming Captain next year
//after Bortan steps down -”

// 17772
//Lee’s voice cut out abruptly and Professor McGonagall’s own amplified voice
//said, “That’s the Ravenclaw team’s own business, Mr. Jordan. Confine yourself
//to the match, please.”

// 17773
//“And the Slytherins take possession - Flint hands off the Quaffle to the lovely
//-”

// 17774
//“Mr. Jordan!”

// 17775
//“To the merely acceptable Sharon Vizcaino, whose hair trails behind her like a
//comet as she blazes toward the Ravenclaw defense - now with two Bludgers in
//close pursuit! Pucey’s on Sharon’s tail - what are you doing, Inglebee? - and
//she swerves in midair to avoid - IS THAT THE SNITCH? GO, CHO CHANG, GO, HIGGS
//IS ALREADY - WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING?”

// 17776
//“Calm down, Mr. Jordan!”

// 17777
//“HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO CALM DOWN? THAT WAS THE WORST MISSED PLAY I’VE EVER SEEN!
//And the Snitch is gone - maybe gone for good, after being missed that badly -
//Pucey’s heading off towards the goal posts, Inglebee’s nowhere near him -”

// 17778
//In a distant era of history, maybe in another world entirely, Professor
//Quirrell had undertaken that the House Cup would be awarded to either Slytherin
//or Ravenclaw. Or possibly, somehow, both; for he had promised that three wishes
//would be granted. So far it was looking good on two out of three.

// 17779
//If you just went by the current score, Hufflepuff was leading the race for the
//House Cup by something like five hundred points, thanks to Hufflepuff’s
//students doing their homework and __staying out of trouble.__ It appeared
//that Professor Snape had been strategically taking quite a lot of points from
//Hufflepuffs for, er, the last seven years or so. Slytherin House, reigning
//champion for the last seven years, still had to its advantage a certain
//__generosity__ of its Head of House in handing out points; and this was
//sufficient to put it neck-and-neck with Ravenclaw House, home of the academic
//achievers. Gryffindor was far behind in the last place, as befit the House of
//nonconformists; Gryffindor had Slytherin’s profile when it came to academics
//and mischief, only without the advantage of Professor Snape. Even Fred and
//George had barely broken even on the year.

// 17780
//Ravenclaw House and Slytherin House both needed a lot of points from
//__somewhere__ if either wanted to catch up with Hufflepuff in the next two
//days.

// 17781
//And so far as anyone knew, Professor Quirrell hadn’t done a single thing
//leading to the obvious result. It was happening all by itself, now that one
//lone Professor in Hogwarts had taught a class with creative problem-solving.

// 17782
//The final Quidditch match of the year was between Ravenclaw and Slytherin.
//Earlier in the year, Gryffindor’s initial Quidditch lead had vanished after
//their new Seeker, Emmett Shear, fell off a possibly malfunctioning broomstick
//during his second game. This had also required some hasty rescheduling of the
//remaining games.

// 17783
//This, the final game of the year, wouldn’t end until the Snitch was caught.

// 17784
//Quidditch scores added directly onto the House points total.

// 17785
//And what did you know, today it seemed that both the Slytherin and Ravenclaw
//Seekers just could… not… catch… the… Snitch.

// 17786
//“THE SNITCH WAS PRACTICALLY ON TOP OF YOU, YOU DIM-EYED DIMWIT!”

// 17787
//“Language, Mr. Jordan, or I’ll remove you from this game! Though it
//__was__ a terrible play, I admit.”

// 17788
//Harry had to admit that Lee Jordan and Professor McGonagall had a wonderful
//comedic routine, with Jordan as the banana-man and Professor McGonagall as the
//straight-woman; Harry now felt a little sorry to have missed it at the earlier
//Quidditch matches. It was a side of Professor McGonagall he hadn’t seen before.

// 17789
//A few seats down from where Harry sat in the Hufflepuff section of the
//Quidditch bleachers, there lurked the hulking form of Cedric Diggory. The Super
//Hufflepuff had observed the most recent near-air-collision between Cho Chang
//and Terence Higgs with the keen eye of a wizard who was a Seeker and a
//Quidditch Captain in his own right.

// 17790
//“The Ravenclaw Seeker is new,” Cedric said. “But Higgs is in his seventh year.
//I’ve played against him. He’s better than that.”

// 17791
//“You think it’s a strategy?” asked one of the Hufflepuffs sitting next to
//Cedric.

// 17792
//“It would make sense if Slytherin needed some extra points to lead for the
//Quidditch Cup,” Cedric said. “But Slytherin already has us beat for the title.
//What are they thinking? They could’ve won right there!”

// 17793
//The game had started at six o’ clock in the afternoon. A typical game would
//have gone until seven or so, at which point it would have been time for dinner.
//June in Scotland meant plenty of daylight; sunset wasn’t until ten.

// 17794
//It was at eight pm and six minutes, according to Harry’s watch, when Slytherin
//had just scored another 10 points bringing the score to 170-140, when Cedric
//Diggory leapt out of his seat and shouted “__Those bastards!”__

// 17795
//“Yeah!” cried a young boy beside him, leaping to his own feet. “Who do they
//think they are, scoring points?”

// 17796
//“Not that!” cried Cedric Diggory. “They’re - they’re trying to __steal
//the Cup from us!__”

// 17797
//“But we’re not in the running any more for -”

// 17798
//__“Not the Quidditch Cup! The House Cup!”__

// 17799
//The word spread, with cries of outrage.

// 17800
//That was Harry’s cue.

// 17801
//Harry politely asked a Hufflepuff witch sitting next to him, and another
//Hufflepuff sitting one row above him, if they could move aside. Then Harry drew
//forth from his pouch a huge scroll, and unfurled it into a 2-meter-tall banner
//which stuck in place in midair. The enchantment had been done courtesy of a
//sixth-year Ravenclaw who had a reputation for knowing less about Quidditch than
//Harry did.

// 17802
//In huge, glowing purple letters, the sign read:

// 17803
//JUST BUY A CLOCK

// 17804
//2 : 06 : 47

// 17805
//Beneath it was a Snitch, with a blinking red X over it.

***

// 17806
//Second, after second, after second, the time counter incremented.

// 17807
//As that counter rose higher, there seemed to be an awful lot of Hufflepuffs
//who’d decided that they wanted to sit next to Harry’s banner.

// 17808
//As the game dragged on past nine, there also seemed to be a lot of Gryffindors.

// 17809
//As the sun set and Harry started using Lumos to read his books - he’d given up
//on the actual game a long time ago - there were a noticeable number of
//Ravenclaws who’d betrayed patriotism for sanity.

// 17810
//And Professor Sinistra.

// 17811
//And Professor Vector.

// 17812
//And as the stars began to come out, Professor Flitwick.

// 17813
//The climactic final Quidditch game of the year… dragged on.

***

// 17814
//One of the things Harry hadn’t planned on, when he’d decided to do this, was
//that he would still be out here at - Harry glanced at his watch -
//eleven-oh-four at night. Harry was now reading a sixth-year Transfiguration
//textbook; or rather he’d weighted the book open, illuminated by a Muggle
//glowstick, while he did one of the exercises. Last week, when the graduating
//Ravenclaws were discussing their N.E.W.T. scores, Harry had overheard that
//upper-year Transfiguration practice involved several ‘shaping exercises’ that
//relied more on control and precise thinking than raw power; and Harry had
//promptly set out to learn those, whacking himself hard on the forehead for not
//trying to read __all__ the later-year textbooks earlier. Professor
//McGonagall had approved Harry doing a shaping exercise that involved
//controlling the way in which a Transfiguring object approached its final form -
//for example, Transfiguring a quill so that the shaft grew out first, then the
//barbs. Harry was doing an analogous exercise with pencils, growing out the lead
//first, then surrounding it with wood and finally having the eraser form on top.
//As Harry had suspected, focusing his attention and magic into a particular part
//of the pencil’s ongoing transformation had proven similar to the mental
//discipline used in partial Transfiguration - which could indeed have been used
//to fake the same effect, by partially Transfiguring only the outer layers of
//the object. This way was proving relatively easier, though.

// 17815
//Harry finished his current pencil and looked up at the Quidditch game, which
//was, check, still fantastically boring. Lee Jordan was commentating in a tone
//of dull disgust, “Another ten points - yay - whoopee - and now someone takes
//possession of the Quaffle again - ask if I care who.”

// 17816
//Almost nobody remaining in the stands was paying attention either, since
//everyone who’d remained in the stadium seemed to have discovered a new and more
//interesting sport, the debate about how to amend the House Cup rules and/or
//Quidditch. The argument had become heated to the point where all of the nearby
//Professors were barely keeping order at a level short of open combat. This
//argument, unfortunately, had considerably more than two factions. Some darned
//busybodies were proposing sensible-sounding alternatives to eliminating the
//Snitch entirely, and this was threatening to split the vote and sap the
//momentum for reform.

// 17817
//In retrospect, Harry thought, it would have been nice to have Draco unfurl his
//own banner from the Slytherin side saying ‘SNITCHES ARE AWESOME’, to set the
//polarity of the debate. Harry had squinted over at the Slytherin section
//earlier, but he hadn’t been able to spot Draco anywhere in the stands. Severus
//Snape, who could also have been sympathetic enough to play the villainous
//opposition, was likewise nowhere to be seen.

// 17818
//“Mr. Potter?” said a voice next to him.
//! 20%

// 17819
//Beside Harry’s seat was standing a short but older Hufflepuff boy, someone
//who’d never before come to Harry’s attention, holding out a blank parchment
//envelope with wax dripped on the front. The wax was also blank, without
//impression.

// 17820
//“What is it?” said Harry.

// 17821
//“It’s __me,__” said the boy. “With the envelope you gave me. I know you
//said not to talk to you, but -”

// 17822
//“Then don’t talk to me,” Harry said.

// 17823
//The boy tossed the envelope at Harry and walked away, looking offended. It made
//Harry wince a little, but it probably hadn’t been the __wrong__ decision
//considering the temporal issues…

// 17824
//Then Harry broke the unsigned wax seal and drew out the envelope’s contents. It
//was parchment instead of the Muggle paper that Harry would have expected, but
//the writing on it was his own handwriting, if done with a quill instead of a
//pen. The parchment said:

// 17825
//__Beware the constellation,__

// 17826
//__and help the watcher of stars.__

// 17827
//__Pass unseen by the life-eaters’ confederates,__

// 17828
//__and by the wise and the well-meaning.__

// 17829
//__Six, and seven in a square,__

// 17830
//__in the place that is prohibited and bloody stupid.__

// 17831
//Harry took it in at a glance, then folded the paper again and put it back into
//his cloak with another exhaled sigh. ‘Beware the constellation’, really? Harry
//would have expected a riddle left by himself, to himself, to have been easier
//to interpret… though some parts were obvious enough. Clearly future-Harry had
//been worried about this paper being intercepted, and while present-Harry
//wouldn’t ordinarily have thought of the local Aurors as ‘the ones in league
//with the Dementors of Azkaban’, maybe that had been the best way to say ‘Auror’
//without potentially tipping off anyone else who read the parchment and did
//their own best to decrypt it. Translating the idiom back out of the
//Parseltongue he’d used during the Incident with Azkaban… that worked, Harry
//supposed.

// 17832
//The note had said that Professor Quirrell needed help, and that whatever was
//going on needed to pass unnoticed from the Aurors, and from Dumbledore and
//McGonagall and Flitwick. Since Time-Turning was involved already, the obvious
//solution was to leave for the loo, travel back in time, and return to the game
//right after he’d left.

// 17833
//Harry started to rise from his seat, then hesitated. His Hufflepuff side was
//remarking something about leaving the Auror escorts behind and not telling
//Professor McGonagall anything, and wondering if his future self was being
//__stupid.__

// 17834
//Harry unfolded the parchment again, and took another glance at the contents.

// 17835
//On closer examination, the riddle-verse didn’t say that Harry couldn’t bring
//__anyone__ along. Draco Malfoy… was he missing from the Quidditch game
//because future-Harry, hours in the past, had brought Draco with him as backup?
//But that didn’t make sense, there wasn’t much marginal improvement in safety
//from bringing along another first-year…

// 17836
//…Draco Malfoy would certainly have been present, regardless of his personal
//feelings about Quidditch, to watch Slytherin clinch the House Cup. Had
//something happened to him?

// 17837
//Suddenly Harry didn’t feel as tired anymore.

// 17838
//A trickle of adrenaline was starting to rise in Harry, but no, this wouldn’t be
//like the troll. The message had __told__ Harry when to arrive. Harry
//wouldn’t be too late, not this time.

// 17839
//Harry glanced over at where Cedric Diggory was looking back and forth, visibly
//torn between a clutch of Ravenclaws arguing that the Snitch had to be kept
//because it was traditional and rules were rules, and a pack of Hufflepuffs
//saying that it wasn’t fair for the Seeker to be more important than the other
//players.

// 17840
//Cedric Diggory had been an excellent dueling tutor to Harry and Neville, and
//Harry had thought they’d established a good relationship. More importantly, a
//student taking literally all of the electives would have his own Time-Turner.
//Maybe Harry could try to get Cedric to go back in time with him? The Super
//Hufflepuff seemed like a good spare wand to have by your side in any sort of
//sticky situation…

***

// 17841
//__Later, and earlier:__

// 17842
//Harry’s watch now said 11:45, which translated into 6:45pm after looping back
//five hours.

// 17843
//“It’s time,” Harry murmured to the empty air, and began walking down the
//third-floor corridor above the grand staircase, on the right-hand side.

// 17844
//‘The place that is prohibited’ would ordinarily mean the Forbidden Forest; that
//was probably what someone intercepting the message was meant to think. But the
//Forbidden Forest was huge, and there was more than one distinguished location
//inside it. No obvious Schelling Point at which to rendezvous, or find some
//event that needed intervention.

// 17845
//But when you added the ‘bloody stupid’ modifier, there was only one prohibited
//place in Hogwarts that fit.

// 17846
//And so Harry set forth on that outlawed path where, if rumor spoke true, all
//the first-year Gryffindors had gone before. The third-floor corridor, on the
//right-hand side. A mysterious door leading to a series of rooms filled with
//dangerous and potentially lethal traps that nobody could possibly get through,
//especially if they were only in their first year.

// 17847
//Harry didn’t know himself what sort of traps awaited. Which, on reflection,
//meant that the students who’d gone through had been surprisingly scrupulous
//about not ruining the puzzle for others. Maybe there was a sign down there
//saying __Don’t give it away, just as a favor to me, sincerely Headmaster
//Dumbledore__. All Harry knew so far was that the outer door would open to
//__Alohomora,__ and that the final room contained a magic mirror that would
//show your reflection in some situation you found highly appealing, which was
//apparently the big payoff.

// 17848
//The third-floor corridor was illuminated by dim blue light that seemed to come
//from nowhere, and the arches were covered with cobwebs, as though the corridor
//hadn’t been used in centuries rather than just the last year.

// 17849
//Harry’s pouch was loaded with useful Muggle things, and useful wizarding
//things, and everything he’d found that could possibly be a quest item. (Harry
//had asked Professor McGonagall to recommend someone who could expand the
//pouch’s capacity, and she’d just done it herself.) Harry had applied the Charm
//he’d learned for battles that made his eyeglasses stick to his face, regardless
//of how his head moved. Harry had refreshed the Transfigurations he was
//maintaining, both the tiny jewel in the ring on his hand and the other one, in
//case he was knocked unconscious. He wasn’t literally ready for anything, but
//Harry was as ready as he thought he could be.

// 17850
//The five-sided floor tiles creaked beneath Harry’s shoes and vanished behind
//him like the future becoming the past. It was almost 6:49-__six, and
//seven in a square.__ Obvious if you thought in Muggle math, otherwise not so
//much.

// 17851
//Just as Harry was about to round another corner, something tickled at the back
//of his mind, and he heard a soft voice talking.

// 17852
//“…sensible person… wait until later… after certain faculty had departed…”

// 17853
//Harry stopped, then crept forward as lightly as he could, not going around the
//corner, trying to hear Professor Quirrell’s voice better.

// 17854
//There came a louder cough, and then the soft voice spoke again from around the
//corner. “But if they were also… to depart themselves… at that time…” murmured
//the voice, “they might think… this final game… makes for the best distraction…
//left in this year… a predictable distraction. So I looked… to see what people
//of significance… were not at the game… and I saw the Headmaster missing… but
//for all my magic can tell me… he could be in another… realm of existence… I
//also saw your own absence… so I decided to go… where you were. That is what I
//am doing here… now… what are __you__ doing here?”

// 17855
//Harry breathed shallowly, and listened.

// 17856
//“And just how did you know where I was?” drawled the voice of Severus Snape, so
//much louder that Harry nearly jumped.

// 17857
//A small, coughing laugh. “Check your wand… for Trace.”

// 17858
//Severus said something in magical pseudo-Latin, and then, “You dared tamper
//with my wand? You __dared?__”

// 17859
//“You are a suspect… just like myself… so your false indignation is wasted…
//however finely crafted it may be… now tell me… what are you doing?”

// 17860
//“I am watching this door,” said the voice of Professor Snape. “And I will ask
//you to be off from it!”

// 17861
//“On whose authority… are you ordering me… my fellow Professor?”

// 17862
//There was a pause, then, “Why, the Headmaster’s,” came the smooth voice of
//Severus Snape. “I was ordered by him to watch this door during the Quidditch
//match, and as a Professor I must obey his whims. I shall have words about it
//with the Board of Governors later, but for now I am doing as I must. Now be off
//with you, as the Headmaster desires.”

// 17863
//“What? You mean I am to believe… that you abandoned your Slytherins… during
//their most important… game of the year… and leapt up like a dog… at
//Dumbledore’s word? Well that… I must say… is entirely plausible. Even so… I
//think it would be wise… if I kept my own watch over you… while you watch this
//fine door.” There was a sound of rustling cloth and a soft thud, as if someone
//had sat down hard upon the ground, or maybe just fallen.

// 17864
//“Oh, for the love of Merlin -” Severus Snape’s voice now sounded angry. “Get
//up, you!”

// 17865
//“Ba-blu-a-bu-bluh -” said the Defense Professor’s zombie-mode.

// 17866
//“Get up!” said Severus Snape, and there was a soft thud.

// 17867
//__Help the watcher of stars -__

// 17868
//Harry stepped around the corner, though it was possible that he’d have done so
//even without an intertemporal message. Had Professor Snape just __kicked__
//Professor Quirrell? That would have been foolhardy if Professor Quirrell had
//been dead and __buried.__

// 17869
//A round-topped door of dark wood was framed within a stone arch, set within the
//dusty marble bricks of Hogwarts. Where a Muggle would have set a doorknob there
//was only a handle of polished metal; there were no visible locks, or visible
//keyholes. Set upon the wall to either side, a pair of torches burned, sending
//forth an ominous orange glow. Before the door stood the Potions Master in his
//customary stained robes. Beside the door, to the left side beneath the orange
//torch, slumped the form of the Defense Professor, back against the wall, head
//staring out at the surroundings. The eyes seemed to flicker, as if halfway
//between awareness, and emptiness.

// 17870
//“__What__,” said the towering form of the Potions Master, “are you doing
//here, __Potter?__”

// 17871
//Going by facial expressions and tone of voice, the Potions Master was quite
//angry with Harry; and certainly was not Harry’s co-conspirator in councils to
//which the Defense Professor had never been invited.

// 17872
//“I’m not sure,” Harry said. He wasn’t sure what role he should be playing, and
//was, in desperation, falling back on simple honesty. “I think perhaps I’m
//supposed to be keeping an eye on the Defense Professor.”

// 17873
//The Potions Master stared at him coldly. “Where’s your __escort,__ Potter?
//Students are not to wander these halls alone!”

// 17874
//Harry’s mind was genuinely blank. The game was afoot, and nobody had told him
//the rules. “I’m not sure how to answer that…”

// 17875
//The cold expression on Professor Snape’s face flickered. “Perhaps I should call
//the Aurors,” he said.

// 17876
//“Wait!” Harry blurted.

// 17877
//The Potions Master’s hand hovered about his robes. “Why?” said the Potions
//Master.

// 17878
//“I… I just think you probably shouldn’t call them…”

// 17879
//In a blur, the Potions Master’s wand was in his hand. “__Nullus
//confundio!” __A black jet darted out and hit Harry, striking in the direction
//Harry had already started to evade. There followed four other spells,
//containing words like __Polyfluis__ and __Metamorphus;__ and for
//those Harry politely stood still.

// 17880
//After all of those spells had failed to produce any effect, Severus Snape was
//staring at Harry with a dark glitter that now seemed genuine. “I suggest,” the
//Potions Master said softly, “that you explain yourself, Potter.”
//! 40%

// 17881
//“I can’t explain myself,” Harry said. “I don’t have the Time, not yet.”

// 17882
//Harry looked directly into the Potions Master’s gaze as he said the words
//__myself__ and __time__, widening his own eyes to try to convey the
//key information, and the Potions Master hesitated.

// 17883
//Harry was frantically trying to work out who was pretending to be what. Since
//Professor Quirrell wasn’t in on Dumbledore’s conspiracy, Severus was pretending
//to be the evil Potions Master of Hogwarts, who’d been sent here by the
//Headmaster… and might or might not have actually been sent here by Dumbledore…
//but Professor Quirrell either thought, or was pretending to think, that someone
//needed to keep an eye on Professor Snape… and Harry himself had been sent here
//by future-Harry and had no idea why… and why were they all standing outside the
//Headmaster’s forbidden door in the first place?

// 17884
//And then…

// 17885
//From behind where Harry stood…

// 17886
//Came the growing sound of another set of footsteps, rapid and manyfold.

// 17887
//Professor Snape stabbed his wand once, creating a burst of darkness that
//shrouded where the Defense Professor was lying. “__Muffliato,__” the
//Potions Master hissed. “Mr. Potter, if you must be here, then hide! Put on your
//invisibility cloak! My duty is to guard this door in case __he__ comes
//here. And there has been - a __disturbance__, meant to draw the
//Headmaster, he thinks -”

// 17888
//“Who -”

// 17889
//Severus took a long stride forward and snapped his wand against the side of
//Harry’s head. There was a trickling sensation like an egg had been cracked over
//him, the feeling of a Disillusionment Charm; and Harry’s hands faded out,
//followed by the rest of him.

// 17890
//The darkness shrouding one side of the wall dissipated like slow mist, and
//there was again visible the huddled form of the Defense Professor, who said
//nothing.

// 17891
//Harry tiptoed away quietly as he could, then turned to watch.

// 17892
//The approaching footsteps rounded the corner -

// 17893
//“What are you doing here?” came many simultaneous cries.

// 17894
//Trimmed in three sets of Slytherin green and one Hufflepuff yellow stood
//Theodore Nott, Daphne Greengrass, Susan Bones, and Tracey Davis.

// 17895
//“__Where,__” said Professor Snape with mounting wrath, “are your
//__escorts,__ children? First-years must be accompanied by a sixth or
//seventh-year student at all times! Especially you!”

// 17896
//Theodore Nott raised his hand. “We’re, um,” said Theodore Nott. “We’re doing
//what the Chaos Legion calls a team-building exercise… see, we realized just now
//that none of us had tried the Headmaster’s forbidden chamber yet, and there
//wasn’t much time left… and Harry Potter has authorized it, Professor, he said
//specifically that __you__ mustn’t interfere.”

// 17897
//Severus Snape turned to glance over at where Harry Potter had tiptoed; a storm
//seemed to be gathering on his brow, and a dark fury in his eyes.

// 17898
//__I… maybe?__ There was still one hour left on Harry’s Time-Turner, so it
//was possible.

// 17899
//“Harry Potter does not have that authority,” the Potions Master said in a
//deceptively mild tone. “Explain yourselves, now.”

// 17900
//“Really?” said the form of Susan Bones. “Really? You’re telling Professor Snape
//that Harry Potter authorized the mission, that’s your idea of a bluff?” The
//young Hufflepuff turned to Professor Snape and spoke, her voice strangely firm.
//“Professor, this is the truth and it’s urgent. Draco Malfoy is missing and we
//think he went down there -”

// 17901
//“If Mr. Malfoy is missing,” said Professor Snape, “__why have the Aurors
//not been notified?__”

// 17902
//“Because of, because of __reasons!__” cried Daphne Greengrass. “There’s no
//time, you’ve got to let us through!”

// 17903
//Professor Snape’s voice was now as sardonic as Harry had ever heard it. “Are
//you four morons under the impression that you are on some sort of adventure?
//Well, you are mistaken. I assure you that Mr. Malfoy has not passed through
//this door.”

// 17904
//“We think Mr. Malfoy has an invisibility cloak,” Susan Bones said rapidly. “Do
//you remember the door seeming to open for no reason?”

// 17905
//“No,” the Potions Master said. “Now be gone from here. This place is off-limits
//for today.”

// 17906
//“This is __Dumbledore’s__ forbidden corridor,” Tracey said. “The
//Headmaster himself said nobody was to come here. Who do you think you are,
//forbidding it too?”

// 17907
//“Miss Davis,” said the Potions Master, “you need to stop associating with
//Gryffindors, especially those named Lavender Brown. And if you are still here
//in one minute, I will file papers requesting your transfer into that House.”

// 17908
//“__You wouldn’t dare!__” shrieked Tracey.

// 17909
//“Hm,” Susan Bones said, her face screwed up in concentration. “Professor Snape,
//do you occasionally open the door yourself, to check on whatever’s inside?”

// 17910
//Professor Snape froze in place. Then he spun and put his right hand on the
//metal knocker -

// 17911
//Harry was watching the hand on the knocker, so he didn’t notice what Professor
//Snape was doing with his left hand until he heard the sudden outcry.

// 17912
//“No, in fact,” said Professor Snape, now holding the choking head of Draco
//Malfoy by his collar, though the rest of Draco was still underneath his
//invisibility cloak. “A fine try, though.”

// 17913
//“__What?__” cried Tracey and Daphne.

// 17914
//Susan Bones hit herself in the forehead. “I can’t __believe__ I fell for
//that.”

// 17915
//“So, Mr. Malfoy,” Professor Snape said. His voice had lowered. “You sent your
//friends here on a ruse… just in the hopes that you could pass through this
//door? Now why would you do that?”

// 17916
//“I think we should trust him -” said Theodore Nott. “Mr. Malfoy, we’ve
//__got__ to trust him, he’s the one Professor who would take our side!”

// 17917
//“No!” cried Draco’s floating head, from where Professor Snape was still
//grasping his collar. “You mustn’t say anything! Stop!”

// 17918
//“We’ve got to take the chance!” yelled Theodore. “Professor Snape, Mr. Malfoy
//finally worked out what’s been going on this whole year, and why - Dumbledore
//is trying to get the Philosopher’s Stone away from Nicholas Flamel! Because
//Dumbledore doesn’t think anyone ought to have immortality! So Dumbledore tried
//to convince Flamel that the Dark Lord was coming back and needed the Stone to
//revive, and asked Flamel to give it to him, but Flamel wouldn’t, and instead
//Flamel put the Stone in the magic mirror that’s down there, and Dumbledore is
//finding out right now how to get it, and then he’ll come for it and we’ve got
//to get to it first! Dumbledore really will be all-powerful if he gets the
//Philosopher’s Stone!”

// 17919
//“__What?__” said Tracey. “That’s not what you said before!”

// 17920
//“It -” Daphne said. She looked frightened, but determined. “It doesn’t matter -
//Professor Snape, please, you __have__ to believe me. I looked at the books
//Hermione checked out of the library, and she was researching the Philosopher’s
//Stone just before someone killed her. Her notes said that something dangerous
//might happen if the Stone stays inside the mirror too long. We have to get it
//out of the castle right away.”

// 17921
//Susan Bones now had both hands over her face. “I’m not with them, I just came
//along to prevent anything even stupider from happening.”

// 17922
//Severus Snape was staring at Theodore Nott and the others. Then he turned his
//head to look at Draco Malfoy. “Mr. Malfoy,” the Potions Master drawled. “How
//did you come to discover Dumbledore’s plot?”

// 17923
//“I deduced it from evidence!” said Draco Malfoy’s floating head.

// 17924
//Professor Snape’s head swiveled back to Theodore Nott. “How did you intend to
//obtain this Stone from inside a magic mirror that could supposedly baffle
//Dumbledore himself? Answer me at once!”

// 17925
//“We’re going to take the whole mirror and send it back to Flamel,” said
//Theodore Nott. “It’s not like we want the Stone for ourselves, we just need to
//stop Dumbledore from stealing it.”

// 17926
//Professor Snape nodded, as though confirming something, and turned his head to
//look at the other students. “Tell me, have any of you noticed one of the others
//behaving in an unusual fashion? Especially if there is a peculiar object that
//they have in their possession, or they can use spells a first-year should not
//know?” Professor Snape’s right hand now pointed his wand at Susan Bones. “I see
//that Miss Greengrass and Miss Davis are trying not to look at you, Miss Bones.
//If there is a mundane explanation, you would be wise to offer it
//__immediately.__”

// 17927
//Susan Bones’s hair turned bright red, though her face didn’t change. “I suppose
//there’s not much point keeping it mum any longer,” she said, “since I’m
//graduating in two days anyway.”

// 17928
//“Double witches get to graduate __six years__ early?” said Tracey Davis.
//“That’s not fair!”

// 17929
//__“Bones is a double witch?”__ cried Theodore.

// 17930
//“No, she is Nymphadora Tonks, a Metamorphmagus,” Professor Snape said.
//“Masquerading as another student is extremely against regulation, as you are
//well aware, Miss Tonks. It is not too late to expel you from Hogwarts two days
//before your graduation, which would be a dreadful tragedy - from your
//perspective, that is. From my perspective it would be hilarious. Now tell me
//what exactly you are doing here.”

// 17931
//“That explains it,” said Daphne Greengrass. “Um, is there __actually__ a
//Susan Bones, or is the House dying out so they had you secretly -”

// 17932
//The red-haired form of Susan Bones had a palm to her face. “Yes, Miss
//Greengrass, there’s a real Susan Bones. She only sends me in when __you__
//lot are about to get into ridiculous amounts of trouble. Professor Snape, the
//reason I’m here is because Draco Malfoy was missing, and this lot
//__insisted__ on trying to find him instead of calling the Aurors. For
//reasons the real Miss Bones said there was no time to explain to me, which I
//now realize were stupid. But young students must never go alone, and must be
//accompanied by a sixth or seventh year at all times. And now we found Draco
//Malfoy and we can all go back. Please? Before this gets any more ridiculous?”

// 17933
//“__What in Merlin’s name is going on here?”__

// 17934
//“Ah,” said Professor Snape, who was still pointing the wand at the red-haired
//form of Susan Bones, his other hand still grasping the collar below the
//disembodied head of Draco Malfoy, standing next to the crumpled form of the
//Defense Professor. “Professor Sprout, I perceive.”

// 17935
//“It’s not what it looks like,” volunteered Tracey Davis.

// 17936
//The short, dumpy form of the Herbology Professor stormed forwards. She had, by
//this point, drawn her wand, though she wasn’t pointing it at anyone. __“I
//don’t even know what this looks like!__ Down wands, all of you, __right
//now!__ Including you, Professor!”

// 17937
//__Distraction.__ The thought came to Harry with sudden clarity. Whatever
//he was watching now, from where he stood invisibly and well back of the action,
//it wasn’t __what was really going on__, it wasn’t the true thread of the
//story, it had been __arranged__. Professor Sprout’s arrival had broken
//Harry’s suspension of disbelief; things like that didn’t happen just for the
//sake of comedic coincidence. Someone was deliberately causing all this chaos,
//but what was the point?

// 17938
//Harry really hoped he hadn’t gone back in time and done this, because it did
//seem like the sort of thing he would do.

// 17939
//Severus Snape lowered his wand. His other hand unfisted Draco Malfoy.
//“Professor Sprout,” the Potions Master said, “I am here on the Headmaster’s
//orders to watch this door. Everyone else present is __not__ supposed to be
//here, and I ask you to see them cleared away.”

// 17940
//“A likely story,” snapped Professor Sprout. “Why would Dumbledore set you of
//all people to guard the door to his playground? It’s not as if he wants to keep
//the students out, oh no, they need to go in and get stuck in __my__
//Devil’s Snare! Susan, dear, you’ve got a communications mirror, don’t you? Use
//it to call the Aurors.”

// 17941
//The watching Harry nodded to himself. __That__ was the point. The Aurors
//would take away everyone present at this terribly confusing situation, no
//excuses accepted, and then the door would be unguarded.

// 17942
//But was Harry meant to go into the forbidden corridor himself? Or watch, to see
//who finally came once all the others were gone?

// 17943
//A loud fit of hacking and coughing caused everyone to look at where the Defense
//Professor lay.
//! 60%

// 17944
//“Snape - listen -” said the Defense Professor between coughs. “Why - Sprout -
//here -”

// 17945
//The Potions Master looked down.

// 17946
//“Memory Charm - implies - Professor -” The Defense Professor began coughing
//again.

// 17947
//“__What?__”

// 17948
//And the logic unfolded in Harry’s mind in crystalline dismay, all the steps
//already suspected, the dreadful realization coming as a repetition with greater
//confidence.

// 17949
//Someone had Memory-Charmed Hermione to believe she’d tried to kill Draco.

// 17950
//Only a Hogwarts Professor could have done it without alarm.

// 17951
//So all the true mastermind needed to do was Legilimise or Imperius a Hogwarts
//Professor.

// 17952
//And the last person anyone would suspect would be the Head of House Hufflepuff.

// 17953
//Snape’s head snapped around, as Professor Sprout raised her wand, and the
//Potions Master managed to raise a wordless translucent ward between them. But
//the bolt that shot from Professor Sprout’s wand was a dark brown that produced
//a surge of awful apprehension in Harry’s mind; and the brown bolt made
//Severus’s shield wink out before they touched, clipping the Potions Master’s
//right arm even as he dodged. Professor Snape gave a muffled shriek and his hand
//spasmed, dropping his wand.

// 17954
//The next bolt that came from Sprout’s wand was a bright red the color of a
//Stunning Hex, seeming to grow brighter and move faster even as it left her
//wand, accompanied by another surge of anxiety; and that blew the Potions Master
//into the door, dropping him motionless to the ground.

// 17955
//By that time pink-haired-Susan-Bones was surrounded by a multifaceted blue haze
//and she was firing hex after hex at Professor Sprout. Professor Sprout was
//ignoring the hexes to summon plant tendrils that entangled the younger students
//as they tried to run, except Draco Malfoy, who had again vanished beneath his
//invisibility cloak.

// 17956
//Not-Susan-Bones stopped casting hexes. She leveled her wand, took a deep
//breath, and cried aloud an incantation that sent golden worms of light chewing
//into the shield around Professor Sprout. At that the Herbology Professor turned
//to face not-Susan, her expression vacant, a new set of plant tentacles rising
//in the air behind her. Those stalks were a darker green, and seemed to have
//shields of their own.

// 17957
//Harry Potter murmured to the seemingly empty air, “Attack Sprout. Help Bones.
//Nonlethal only.”

// 17958
//“Yes, my lord,” whispered Lesath Lestrange beneath Harry’s Cloak of
//Invisibility, and the fifth-year Slytherin’s presence moved off toward the
//fight.

// 17959
//Harry looked down at at his own hands, and saw with a jolt of unpleasant shock
//that his Disillusionment Charm wasn’t as complete as it had been before. There
//were hints of distortion in the air, each time Harry moved…

// 17960
//Slowly, Harry stepped backward, until he came to a corner, and ducked behind a
//wall. Then he took out his communications mirror… which was blank and jammed.
//Of course. Harry levitated the mirror to where he could use it to see around
//the corner, and watch the end of the… distraction? __What was happening,
//why?__

// 17961
//Professor Sprout and the form of Susan Bones were dueling in flashes of light
//and leaves; and the blazing green of a Greater Drill Hex erupted from midair
//and chewed halfway through the outer layer of Professor Sprout’s shields. The
//Herbology Professor turned and fired a broad wash of yellow at where the Drill
//Hex had come from, but the spell didn’t seem to hit anything.

// 17962
//Yellow blazes, blue facets, dark green plant-tendrils and swirling purple
//flower petals…

// 17963
//It was when Professor Sprout started firing arcs of crimson in all directions
//that one of the crimson blades caught something in midair, the Invisibility
//Cloak not concealing how the crimson arc was absorbed and winked out; and
//Lesath’s presence beneath the Invisibility Cloak fell to the ground.

// 17964
//And that gave not-Susan-Bones time enough to stand still, catch her breath, and
//scream something that inspired in Harry another surge of dread; and the white
//spark that blazed out went through Professor Sprout’s chewed shields and her
//plant-armor and dropped her.

// 17965
//Not-Susan-Bones went to her knees, panting, her robes soaked in sweat.

// 17966
//Her head turned to look around her, at the bodies lying stunned on the floor or
//wrapped in vines.

// 17967
//“What,” said not-Susan. “What. What. __What.__”

// 17968
//There was no reply. The victims entangled in Professor Sprout’s vines weren’t
//moving, though they did seem to be breathing.

// 17969
//“Malfoy…” said the pink-haired form of Susan, still gasping for breath. “Draco
//Malfoy, where are you? Are you there? Call the Aurors already! Merlin damn it -
//__Homenum Revelio!__”

// 17970
//And Harry found himself visible again, staring in his mirror at the form of
//Draco Malfoy half-visible beneath a shimmering cloak, standing behind
//not-Susan, pointing his wand at a gap in not-Susan’s blue haze.

// 17971
//Harry’s mind moved in flashes of insight, too slow and yet too fast; even as
//Harry’s mouth opened and he inhaled in preparation to shout.

// 17972
//__beware the constellation__

// 17973
//____there was a constellation named Draco

// 17974
//if you could control a Professor you could control a student

// 17975
//__“Duck!” __Harry shouted, but it was too late, a bolt of red light caught
//the back of not-Susan’s head at point-blank, smashing her to the floor.

// 17976
//Harry stepped around the corner and said, “__Somnium Somnium Somnium
//Somnium Somnium Somnium.__”

// 17977
//Draco Malfoy’s shimmering form collapsed in a heap.

// 17978
//Harry took a moment to catch his breath. Then Harry said “__Stupefy!__”
//and verified that, yes, the Stunning Hex did hit Draco Malfoy’s form.

// 17979
//(You could be mistaken about whether a Somnium had really hit. Harry had seen
//enough horror movies, not to mention the business with the Sunshine Regiment,
//that he wasn’t about to make __that__ error again.)

// 17980
//After a further reflection on this, Harry cast another Stunning Hex into the
//prostrate form of Professor Sprout.

// 17981
//Harry gripped his wand, staring at the scene, breathing heavily from the
//exhaustion. He didn’t have enough magic left to cast a messenger Patronus to
//Dumbledore and he __really really__ should have thought of that
//possibility immediately this time around. Harry started to reach back to where
//his mirror had fallen, to see if it was now unjammed.

// 17982
//And then Harry hesitated.

// 17983
//His note to himself had said to avoid notice from Aurors, and Harry still
//__did not know what was going on.__

// 17984
//The crumpled form of Professor Quirrell gave another series of racking coughs,
//reached out a hand to the wall beside him, and slowly pulled himself to his
//feet.

// 17985
//“Harry,” croaked Professor Quirrell. “Harry. Are you there?”

// 17986
//It was the first time Professor Quirrell had ever called him by his first name.

// 17987
//“I’m here,” Harry said. Without any conscious thought, his feet were moving
//forward.

// 17988
//“Please,” said Professor Quirrell. “Please, I haven’t… much time. Please take
//me… to the mirror… help me… get the Stone.”

// 17989
//“The __Philosopher’s__ Stone?” Harry said. He glanced around at the
//scattered bodies, but he couldn’t see Draco anymore, the revealment had worn
//off. “You think Mr. Nott was __right?__ I don’t think Dumbledore would -”

// 17990
//“Not - Dumbledore,” gasped Professor Quirrell. “Because - Sprout -”

// 17991
//“I understand,” Harry said. If Dumbledore had been the one behind it all, he
//wouldn’t have needed to mind-control a Professor in order to use Memory Charms.

// 17992
//“Mirror… ancient relic… could hide anything… Stone could be there… many others
//want Stone… one sent Sprout…”

// 17993
//Harry repeated rapidly, “The mirror down there is an ancient relic that can be
//used to hide things, and it would be one possible place to hide the
//Philosopher’s Stone. If the Philosopher’s Stone is inside the mirror then any
//number of people might want to get it. One of them is controlling Sprout and
//that would explain what their goal really is… only… that doesn’t explain why
//Sprout’s controller would go after Hermione?”

// 17994
//“Harry, please,” Professor Quirrell said. His breathing was yet more labored
//now, his voice came with excruciating slowness. “It’s the one thing… that can
//save my life… and I find, now… I don’t want to die… please, help me…”

// 17995
//And somehow that tore it.

// 17996
//Somehow that was a little too much.

// 17997
//The sense of detachment that had come over Harry when Professor Sprout had
//arrived, the broken suspension of disbelief, was returning; his Inner Critic
//weighing up everything as though it were a set-piece. Timing, probability, so
//many people showing up at the same door, the Defense Professor’s desperation…
//this whole situation didn’t feel real. But he might be able to __solve
//it__ if he just took time to think things through in advance, instead of running
//off at adventure’s first call. All the accumulated experience from the last
//year had finally crystallized into something like a touch of battle hardening.
//An instinct born of past disaster was telling Harry that if he just rushed on
//ahead, he would end up afterward in a sad conversation, realizing that he’d
//been stupid. __Again.__

// 17998
//“Let me think,” Harry said. “Let me think for a minute before we go.” He turned
//away from the Defense Professor, looking at the unconscious bodies draped in
//various shapes over the floor. There’d been so many puzzle pieces already, this
//last year, maybe everything would just fall into place with one more piece…

// 17999
//“Harry…” the Defense Professor said in a faltering voice. “Harry, I’m dying…”

// 18000
//__One more minute can’t make the difference he’s had the WHOLE YEAR to be
//sick it’s IMPROBABLE that his life versus death would be precisely timed to
//rest on this last minute no matter what happened to Hermione -__

// 18001
//“I __know!__” Harry said. “I’ll think __quickly!__”

// 18002
//Harry stared at the bodies and tried to think. There was no time for doubts,
//for caveats, no brakes or second-guessing just take the first thoughts and
//__run with them -__

// 18003
//In the back of Harry’s mind, fragments of abstract thought flitted past,
//heuristics of problem-solving that there was no time to rehearse in words. In
//wordless flashes they shot past, to set up the object-level problem.

// 18004
//- __what do I notice I am confused by -__

// 18005
//__- the first place to look for a problem is whatever aspect of the
//situation seems most improbable -__

// 18006
//__- simple explanations are more probable, eliminate separate
//improbabilities that must be postulated -__

// 18007
//Professor Snape had already been here then Professor Quirrell had arrived then
//Harry had arrived (via Time-Turner) then the adventuring party had arrived and
//Draco had been revealed (part of the party) then Professor Sprout had shown up.

// 18008
//Too many people had shown up __synchronously__ and that was too much
//coincidence, it was __improbable __that so many different parties would
//show up at the same location within a five-minute window, there __had__ to
//be hidden entanglements.

// 18009
//Label Sprout’s controller as the mastermind who had ordered Hermione
//Memory-Charmed. The mastermind had sent Sprout.

// 18010
//Professor Snape had said that the Headmaster had sent him to guard the door
//after there’d been some sort of __disturbance__, if the mastermind had
//caused that as a distraction then that explained Severus’s presence as well.

// 18011
//Harry wasn’t sure any more that Draco had been controlled by the mastermind,
//that hypothesis had come to him in the spur of the moment, Draco might have
//just been trying to drop not-Susan so he could get into the corridor
//unhindered-

// 18012
//No that was the wrong way to think, turn it around, try to __explain__ the
//timed presence of Draco and his adventuring party, no time for
//self-questioning, __run with the hypothesis,__ therefore suppose Sprout’s
//mastermind had sent Draco or triggered his coming.
//! 80%

// 18013
//That was three arrivals explained.

// 18014
//Harry had shown up because his note to himself had told him to do so. That
//could be attributed to time travel.

// 18015
//That left the Defense Professor who’d said he was following Snape, only that
//didn’t __really__ seem like an adequate reason for Professor Quirrell to
//show up it didn’t really make Harry feel less confused and so maybe the
//mastermind had also controlled the timing of Professor Quirrell’s presence
//somehow and even arranged for Harry himself to enter the time loop.

// 18016
//Harry’s mind hit a stumbling-block, he couldn’t see how to extend that
//reasoning further.

// 18017
//There was no time to stare blankly at stumbling-blocks.

// 18018
//Without any pause or braking Harry’s mind attacked the problem from a new
//angle.

// 18019
//Professor Quirrell had deduced a controlled Hogwarts Professor from the need
//for some Professor to Memory-Charm Hermione which meant that Professor Sprout’s
//controller had framed and then murdered Hermione which meant Professor Sprout’s
//controller had detailed information about Hogwarts life and maybe a personal
//interest in the Boy-Who-Lived and his friends.

// 18020
//Harry’s mind finally threw up the relevant memory, Dumbledore saying that Lord
//Voldemort’s strongest road to life was hidden here inside Hogwarts __run
//with the hypothesis__ so that resurrection tool was the Philosopher’s Stone
//hidden inside the mirror __why had Dumbledore put the mirror into a
//corridor first-years could get through no ignore this question it’s not
//important right now __and Professor Quirrell had said the Philosopher’s Stone
//possessed great healing power so that part also fit.

// 18021
//But if it was the Philosopher’s Stone that was hidden in the mirror to keep it
//away from the Dark Lord, that meant the mirror also contained the one thing in
//the world that could save the Defense Professor’s life -

// 18022
//Harry’s mind tried to hesitate, to flinch away, feeling a sudden apprehension
//as to where this was going.

// 18023
//But there was no time allowed for hesitation.

// 18024
//-and that was also far too much coincidence just too much improbability if your
//mind didn’t write it off as an amazing plot twist like you were inside a story.

// 18025
//Could the putative Dark Lord also be manipulating Professor Quirrell so that
//Professor Quirrell would discover his supposed salvation at the right time so
//that Harry and Professor Quirrell would go get the resurrection tool from the
//mirror that might not even actually be the Philosopher’s Stone and then the
//Dark Lord’s avatar or some other servant would show up and seize it from them
//that would explain __all__ the synchronies and negate every coincidence.

// 18026
//Or Professor Quirrell had known from the beginning that the one thing that
//could save his life was hidden inside this mirror and that was why he had
//agreed to teach Defense at Hogwarts and now he was finally trying to get it but
//then why wait until he was this sick to even try and why had Sprout shown up at
//the same time as Professor Quirrell -

// 18027
//Harry’s mind faltered harder.

// 18028
//His inner eye was looking in a direction it was afraid to look.

// 18029
//__The note I sent myself said to help the watcher of stars. I wouldn’t
//send myself a note saying that, if I hadn’t already worked out in the future
//that it was the right thing to do - maybe the note is just telling me to get on
//with it -__

// 18030
//A small note of confusion was promoted to conscious attention.

// 18031
//The coded message on the parchment… one or two lines hadn’t quite sounded
//right, hadn’t sounded like the code Harry would expect himself to use…

// 18032
//“Harry,” whispered the dying voice of Professor Quirrell from behind him.
//“Harry, please.”

// 18033
//“I’m almost done thinking,” Harry’s voice said aloud, and Harry realized as he
//spoke the words that they were true.

// 18034
//Turn it around.

// 18035
//Look at it from the Enemy’s perspective, from where the Enemy does their own
//intelligent planning, somewhere out of your sight.

// 18036
//There are Aurors in Hogwarts, and your target Harry Potter is now fully on
//guard. Harry Potter will call in Aurors at the first sign of trouble, or send a
//Patronus to Albus Dumbledore. Considering that as a puzzle, one creative
//solution is to -

// 18037
//- forge a supposedly Time-Turned message to Harry Potter from himself, telling
  //Harry Potter __not__ to call for help, telling him to be at the place
//and time you want him to be. You get the target himself to bypass all the
//protections he set up. You even bypass his protection of skepticism with the
//overriding authority of his own future self’s judgment.

// 18038
//It isn’t even difficult. You can Memory-Charm some random student into
//remembering Harry Potter handing over an envelope to be given back to himself
//later.

// 18039
//You can Memory-Charm that student because you are a Hogwarts Professor.

// 18040
//You don’t go to the extra effort to steal a pencil and Muggle paper from Harry
//Potter’s pouch. Instead you forge Harry Potter’s handwriting on wizard
//parchment. You can forge Harry Potter’s handwriting because you have seen it on
//Ministry-mandated exams you have graded.

// 18041
//You call Draco Malfoy ‘the constellation’ because you know Harry Potter is
//interested in astronomy and you are a wizard and you have taken Astronomy and
//memorised the names of all the constellations. But it’s not the natural code
//that Harry Potter would use to describe Draco Malfoy to himself, that would
//have been ‘the apprentice’.

// 18042
//You call Professor Quirrell ‘the watcher of stars’, and tell Harry Potter to
//help him.

// 18043
//You know that life-eater is how you say ‘Dementor’ in Parseltongue and you
//expect Harry Potter to think of the Aurors as being in league with them.

// 18044
//You encode 6:49 as ‘six, and seven in a square’ because you have been reading a
//Muggle physics book that Harry Potter gave you.

// 18045
//Who are you, then?

// 18046
//Harry noticed his breathing had sped up, and with a burst of heartrate, Harry
//slowed his breath down again, Professor Quirrell was __watching him__.

// 18047
//What if hypothetically speaking Professor Quirrell was the mastermind and had
//faked Harry’s message then that explained all five parties showing up the whole
//synchronous coordination of the comedy and then Professor Sprout was just
//controlled to give Professor Quirrell deniability let him blame someone else
//for the False Memory Charm after the dust settled but

// 18048
//But why would Professor Quirrell risk the fragile alliance Harry had with Draco
//via the attempted murder-frame

// 18049
//(that Professor Quirrell had ‘detected’ and ‘stopped’ allegedly via a tracer
//put on Draco)

// 18050
//Why would Professor Quirrell kill Hermione

// 18051
//(if his first attempt to remove her hadn’t worked)

// 18052
//If Professor Quirrell was the bad guy then he might have lied about everything
//to do with horcruxes and maybe it wasn’t coincidence at all that the only thing
//that could save his life was the avenue that could resurrect the Dark Lord what
//if the Dark Lord had arranged that too somehow

// 18053
//(one day David Monroe had mysteriously disappeared, presumed dead at the Dark
//Lord’s hands)

// 18054
//An awful intuition had come over Harry, something separate from all the
//reasoning he’d done so far, an intuition that Harry couldn’t put into words;
//except that he and the Defense Professor were very much alike in certain ways,
//and faking a Time-Turned message was just the sort of creative method that
//Harry himself might have tried to bypass all of a target’s protections -

// 18055
//And that was when Harry finally realized what should have been obvious from the
//very, very beginning.

***

// 18056
//Professor Quirrell was smart.

// 18057
//Professor Quirrell was smart in the same way as Harry.

// 18058
//Professor Quirrell was smart in exactly the same way as Harry’s mysterious dark
//side.

// 18059
//If you had to guess when the Boy-Who-Lived had acquired his mysterious dark
//side, the obvious guess was the night of October 31st, 1981.

***

// 18060
//And

// 18061
//And

// 18062
//And Professor Quirrell had known a password that Bellatrix Black had thought
//identified the Dark Lord and his presence gave the Boy-Who-Lived a sense of
//doom and his magic interacted destructively with Harry’s and his favorite spell
//was Avada Kedavra and and and -

// 18063
//The realization blasted through Harry like a vast dam breaking, releasing out
//all its water, bursting through his mind in an irresistible flood that swept
//everything away.

// 18064
//There is only one reality that generates all of the observations.

// 18065
//If different observations seem to point in incompatible directions, it means
//the true hypothesis is one you haven’t thought of yet.

// 18066
//And in those cases, when you finally think of the correct hypothesis,
//everything aligns behind it, beyond denial or horror, tearing away every doubt
//and every emotion that might stand in its path.

// 18067
//- and then ‘David Monroe’ and ‘Lord Voldemort’ had just been one person playing
  //both sides of the Wizarding War and that was why the Monroe family had been
//killed before they could meet ‘David Monroe’ just like Moody had suspected -

// 18068
//Reality settled down into a single known state, one coherent state-of-affairs
//that compactly generated the observation set.

// 18069
//Harry didn’t jump, didn’t change his breathing, tried not to show a single sign
//of the horror and agony flooding his mind.

// 18070
//The Enemy was behind him, watching him.

// 18071
//“All right,” Harry said out loud, as soon as he dared trust his voice to sound
//normal. He kept on staring at the bodies, looking away from Professor Quirrell,
//because Harry didn’t trust his own face. Harry lifted a sleeve to wipe away the
//sweat on his forehead, trying to make the gesture look casual; Harry couldn’t
//control the sweat, or the rapid hammering in his chest. “Let’s go get the
//Philosopher’s Stone.”

// 18072
//All Harry needed was a single moment of distraction anywhere along the way to
//use his Time-Turner.

// 18073
//There was no reply from behind him.

// 18074
//The silence stretched.

// 18075
//Slowly, Harry turned around.

// 18076
//Professor Quirrell was standing upright and smiling.

// 18077
//In the Defense Professor’s hand was a shape of black metal pointed at Harry’s
//wand arm, held with the sure grip of someone who knew exactly how to use a
//semiautomatic handgun.

// 18078
//Harry’s mouth was dry, even his lips were trembling with adrenaline, but he
//managed to speak. “Hello, Lord Voldemort.”

// 18079
//Professor Quirrell inclined his head in acknowledgement, and said, “Hello, Tom
//Riddle.”
