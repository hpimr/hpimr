// 171
//== Comparing Reality To Its Alternatives

// 172
//If J. K. Rowling asks you about this story, you know nothing.

// 173
//__“But then the question is - who?”__

// 174
//“Good Lord,” said the barman, peering at Harry, “is this - can this be -?”

// 175
//Harry leaned towards the bar of the Leaky Cauldron as best he could, though it
//came up to somewhere around the tips of his eyebrows. A question like
//__that__ deserved his very best.

// 176
//“Am I - could I be - maybe - you never know - if I’m__ not __- but then
//the question is - __who?__”

// 177
//“Bless my soul,” whispered the old barman. “Harry Potter… what an honour.”

// 178
//Harry blinked, then rallied. “Well, yes, you’re quite perceptive; most people
//don’t realise that so quickly -”

// 179
//“That’s enough,” Professor McGonagall said. Her hand tightened on Harry’s
//shoulder. “Don’t pester the boy, Tom, he’s new to all this.”

// 180
//“But it is him?” quavered an old woman. “It’s Harry Potter?” With a scraping
//sound, she got up from her chair.

// 181
//“Doris -” McGonagall said warningly. The glare she shot around the room should
//have been enough to intimidate anyone.

// 182
//“I only want to shake his hand,” the woman whispered. She bent low and stuck
//out a wrinkled hand, which Harry, feeling confused and more uncomfortable than
//he ever had in his life, carefully shook. Tears fell from the woman’s eyes onto
//their clasped hands. “My granson was an Auror,” she whispered to him. “Died in
//seventy-nine. Thank you, Harry Potter. Thank heavens for you.”

// 183
//“You’re welcome,” Harry said automatically, and then he turned his head and
//shot Professor McGonagall a frightened, pleading look.

// 184
//Professor McGonagall slammed her foot down just as the general rush was about
//to start. It made a noise that gave Harry a new referent for the phrase “Crack
//of Doom”, and everyone froze in place.

// 185
//“We’re in a hurry,” Professor McGonagall said in a voice that sounded
//perfectly, utterly normal.

// 186
//They left the bar without any trouble.

// 187
//“Professor?” Harry said, once they were in the courtyard. He had meant to ask
//what was going on, but oddly found himself asking an entirely different
//question instead. “Who was that pale man, by the corner? The man with the
//twitching eye?”

// 188
//“Hm?” said Professor McGonagall, sounding a bit surprised; perhaps she hadn’t
//expected that question either. “That was Professor Quirinus Quirrell. He’ll be
//teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts this year at Hogwarts.”

// 189
//“I had the strangest feeling that I knew him…” Harry rubbed his forehead. “And
//that I shouldn’t ought to shake his hand.” Like meeting someone who had been a
//friend, once, before something went drastically wrong… that wasn’t really it at
//all, but Harry couldn’t find words. “And what __was…__ all of that?”

// 190
//Professor McGonagall was giving him an odd glance. “Mr. Potter… do you know…
//how __much__ have you been told… about how your parents died?”

// 191
//Harry returned a steady look. “My parents are alive and well, and they always
//refused to talk about how my __genetic__ parents died. From which I infer
//that it wasn’t good.”

// 192
//“An admirable loyalty,” said Professor McGonagall. Her voice went low. “Though
//it hurts a little to hear you say it like that. Lily and James were friends of
//mine.”

// 193
//Harry looked away, suddenly ashamed. “I’m sorry,” he said in a small voice.
//“But I __have__ a Mum and Dad. And I know that I’d just make myself
//unhappy by comparing that reality to… something perfect that I built up in my
//imagination.”

// 194
//“That is amazingly wise of you,” Professor McGonagall said quietly. “But your
//__genetic__ parents died very well indeed, protecting you.”

// 195
//__Protecting me?__

// 196
//Something strange clutched at Harry’s heart. “What… __did__ happen?”

// 197
//Professor McGonagall sighed. Her wand tapped Harry’s forehead, and his vision
//blurred for a moment. “Something of a disguise,” she said, “so that this
//doesn’t happen again, not until you’re ready.” Then her wand licked out again,
//and tapped three times on a brick wall…

// 198
//…which hollowed into a hole, and dilated and expanded and shivered into a huge
//archway, revealing a long row of shops with signs advertising cauldrons and
//dragon livers.

// 199
//Harry didn’t blink. It wasn’t like anyone was turning into a cat.

// 200
//And they walked forwards, together, into the wizarding world.

// 201
//There were merchants hawking Bounce Boots (“Made with real Flubber!”) and
//“Knives +3! Forks +2! Spoons with a +4 bonus!” There were goggles that would
//turn anything you looked at green, and a lineup of comfy armchairs with
//ejection seats for emergencies.

// 202
//Harry’s head kept rotating, rotating like it was trying to wind itself off his
//neck. It was like walking through the magical items section of an
//__Advanced Dungeons and Dragons__ rulebook (he didn’t play the game, but
//he did enjoy reading the rulebooks). Harry desperately didn’t want to miss a
//single item for sale, in case it was one of the three you needed to complete
//the cycle of infinite __wish__ spells.

// 203
//Then Harry spotted something that made him, entirely without thinking, veer off
//from the Deputy Headmistress and start heading straight into the shop, a front
//of blue bricks with bronze-metal trim. He was brought back to reality only when
//Professor McGonagall stepped right in front of him.

// 204
//“Mr. Potter?” she said.

// 205
//Harry blinked, then realised what he’d just done. “I’m sorry! I forgot for a
//moment that I was with you instead of my family.” Harry gestured at the shop
//window, which displayed fiery letters that shone piercingly bright and yet
//remote, spelling out __Bigbam’s Brilliant Books__. “When you walk past a
//bookshop you haven’t visited before, you have to go in and look around. That’s
//the family rule.”

// 206
//“That is the most Ravenclaw thing I have ever heard.”

// 207
//“What?”

// 208
//“Nothing. Mr. Potter, our first step is to visit Gringotts, the bank of the
//wizarding world. Your __genetic__ family vault is there, with the
//inheritance your __genetic__ parents left you, and you’ll need money for
//school supplies.” She sighed. “And, I suppose, a certain amount of spending
//money for books could be excused as well. Though you might want to hold off for
//a time. Hogwarts has quite a large library on magical subjects. And the tower
//in which, I strongly suspect, you will be living, has a more broad-ranging
//library of its own. Any book you bought now would probably be a duplicate.”

// 209
//Harry nodded, and they walked on.

// 210
//“Don’t get me wrong, it’s a __great__ distraction,” Harry said as his head
//kept swivelling, “probably the best distraction anyone has ever tried on me,
//but don’t think I’ve forgotten about our pending discussion.”

// 211
//Professor McGonagall sighed. “Your parents - or your mother at any rate - may
//have been very wise not to tell you.”

// 212
//“So you wish that I could continue in blissful ignorance? There is a certain
//flaw in that plan, Professor McGonagall.”

// 213
//“I suppose it would be rather pointless,” the witch said tightly, “when anyone
//on the street could tell you the story. Very well.”

// 214
//And she told him of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, the Dark Lord, Voldemort.

// 215
//“Voldemort?” Harry whispered. It should have been funny, but it wasn’t. The
//name burned with a cold feeling, ruthlessness, diamond clarity, a hammer of
//pure titanium descending upon an anvil of yielding flesh. A chill swept over
//Harry even as he pronounced the word, and he resolved then and there to use
//safer terms like You-Know-Who.

// 216
//The Dark Lord had raged upon wizarding Britain like a wilding wolf, tearing and
//rending at the fabric of their everyday lives. Other countries had wrung their
//hands but hesitated to intervene, whether out of apathetic selfishness or
//simple fear, for whichever was first among them to oppose the Dark Lord, their
//peace would be the next target of his terror.

// 217
//(__The bystander effect,__ thought Harry, thinking of Latane and Darley’s
//experiment which had shown that you were more likely to get help if you had an
//epileptic fit in front of one person than in front of three. __Diffusion
//of responsibility, everyone hoping that someone else would go first.__)

// 218
//The Death Eaters had followed in the Dark Lord’s wake and in his vanguard,
//carrion vultures to pick at wounds, or snakes to bite and weaken. The Death
//Eaters were not as terrible as the Dark Lord, but they were terrible, and they
//were many. And the Death Eaters wielded more than wands; there was wealth
//within those masked ranks, and political power, and secrets held in blackmail,
//to paralyse a society trying to protect itself.

// 219
//An old and respected journalist, Yermy Wibble, called for increased taxes and
//conscription. He shouted that it was absurd for the many to cower in fear of
//the few. His skin, only his skin, had been found nailed to the newsroom wall
//that next morning, next to the skins of his wife and two daughters. Everyone
//wished for something more to be done, and no one dared take the lead to propose
//it. Whoever stood out the most became the next example.

// 220
//Until the names of James and Lily Potter rose to the top of that list.

// 221
//And those two might have died with their wands in their hands and not regretted
//their choices, for they __were__ heroes; but for that they had an infant
//child, their son, Harry Potter.

// 222
//Tears were coming into Harry’s eyes. He wiped them away in anger or maybe
//desperation, __I didn’t know those people, not really, they aren’t my
//parents __now,__ it would be pointless to feel so sad for them -__

// 223
//When Harry was done sobbing into the witch’s robes, he looked up, and felt a
//little bit better to see tears in Professor McGonagall’s eyes as well.

// 224
//“So what happened?” Harry said, his voice trembling.

// 225
//“The Dark Lord came to Godric’s Hollow,” Professor McGonagall said in a
//whisper. “You should have been hidden, but you were betrayed. The Dark Lord
//killed James, and he killed Lily, and he came in the end to you, to your cot.
//He cast the Killing Curse at you, and that was where it ended. The Killing
//Curse is formed of pure hate, and strikes directly at the soul, severing it
//from the body. It cannot be blocked, and whomever it strikes, they die. But you
//survived. You are the only person ever to survive. The Killing Curse rebounded
//and struck the Dark Lord, leaving only the burnt hulk of his body and a scar
//upon your forehead. That was the end of the terror, and we were free. That,
//Harry Potter, is why people want to see the scar on your forehead, and why they
//want to shake your hand.”

// 226
//The storm of weeping that had washed through Harry had used up all his tears;
//he could not cry again, he was done.

// 227
//(And somewhere in the back of his mind was a small, small note of confusion, a
//sense of something wrong about that story; and it should have been a part of
//Harry’s art to notice that tiny note, but he was distracted. For it is a sad
//rule that whenever you are most in need of your art as a rationalist, that is
//when you are most likely to forget it.)

// 228
//Harry detached himself from Professor McGonagall’s side. “I’ll - have to think
//about this,” he said, trying to keep his voice under control. He stared at his
//shoes. “Um. You can go ahead and call them my parents, if you want, you don’t
//have to say ‘genetic parents’ or anything. I guess there’s no reason I can’t
//have two mothers and two fathers.”

// 229
//There was no sound from Professor McGonagall.

// 230
//And they walked together in silence, until they came before a great white
//building with vast bronze doors, and carven words above saying
//__Gringotts Bank.__
