//== The Truth, Pt 2

// 18083
//__Tom Riddle.__

// 18084
//The words seemed to echo inside Harry’s head, sparking resonances that as
//quickly died away, broken patterns trying to complete themselves and failing.

// 18085
//__Tom Riddle is a__

// 18086
//__Tom Riddle was the__

// 18087
//__Riddle__

// 18088
//There were other priorities occupying Harry’s attention.

// 18089
//Professor Quirrell was pointing a gun at him.

// 18090
//And for some reason Lord Voldemort hadn’t fired it yet.

// 18091
//Harry’s voice came out in more of a croak. “What is it that you want from me?”

// 18092
//“Your death,” said Professor Quirrell, “is clearly not what I am about to say,
//since I have had plenty of time to kill you if I wished. The fateful battle
//between Lord Voldemort and the Boy-Who-Lived is a figment of Dumbledore’s
//imagination. I know where to find your family’s house in Oxford, and I am
//familiar with the concept of sniper rifles. You would have died before you ever
//touched a wand. I hope this is clear to you, Tom?”

// 18093
//“Crystal,” Harry whispered. His body was still shaking, running programs more
//suited to fleeing a tiger than casting delicate spells or __thinking.__
//But Harry could think of one thing the person pointing a gun at him obviously
//wanted him to do, a question that person was waiting for him to ask, and Harry
//did so. “Why are you calling me Tom?”

// 18094
//Professor Quirrell regarded him steadily. “Why __am__ I calling you Tom?
//Answer. Your intellect is not everything I hoped for, but it should suffice for
//this.”

// 18095
//Harry’s mouth seemed to know the answer before his brain could manage to focus
//on the question. “Tom Riddle is your name. Our name. That’s who Lord Voldemort
//is, or was, or - something.”

// 18096
//Professor Quirrell nodded. “Better. You have already vanquished the Dark Lord,
//the one and only time that you will ever do so. I have already destroyed all
//but a remnant of Harry Potter, eliminating the difference between our spirits
//and enabling us to reside in the same world. Now that it is clear to you that
//the battle between us is a lie, you might act sensibly to advance your own
//interests. Or you might not.” The gun jabbed slightly forward, causing prickles
//of sweat to appear on Harry’s forehead. “Drop your wand. __Now__.”

// 18097
//Harry dropped it.

// 18098
//“Step away from the wand,” said Professor Quirrell.

// 18099
//Harry obeyed.

// 18100
//“Reach toward your neck,” said Professor Quirrell, “and remove your
//Time-Turner, touching it by the chain only. Place the Time-Turner on the
//ground, then step away from it as well.”

// 18101
//This also Harry did. Even in his state of shock, his mind still looked for a
//way to spin the Time-Turner in the process, a sudden move that would win; but
//Harry knew that Professor Quirrell would already be imagining himself in
//Harry’s position, looking for the same possible opportunities.

// 18102
//“Remove your pouch and place it also on the ground, then step away.”

// 18103
//Harry did this.

// 18104
//“Very good,” said the Defense Professor. “Now. It is time for me to obtain the
//Philosopher’s Stone. I mean to bring along these four first-years here,
//suitably Obliviated of their most recent memories so that they still recall
//their original purpose. Snape I shall control and set to guard this door. After
//this day’s work is done, I intend to kill Snape for the betrayals he has
//offered my other identity. The three heir-children I shall take with me
//afterwards, to shape their future loyalties. And know this, I have taken
//hostages. I have already set in motion a spell that will kill hundreds of
//Hogwarts students, including many you called friends. I can stop that spell
//using the Stone, if I obtain it successfully. If I am interrupted before then,
//or if I choose not to stop the spell, hundreds of students will die.” Professor
//Quirrell’s voice was still mild. “Do you yet perceive any interests you have at
//stake, boy? I would smile to hear you say ‘no’, but that is too much to hope.”

// 18105
//“I’d like,” Harry managed to say, through the horror, and the heartbreak, and
//the knives slicing away at an emotional connection that hurt like living flesh
//as it was cut, “for you not to do those things, Professor.” __Why,
//Professor Quirrell, why, why did it have to turn out like this, I don’t, I
//don’t, I don’t want this to be happening…__

// 18106
//“Very well,” Professor Quirrell said. “I grant you permission to offer me
//something I want.” The gun gestured invitingly. “That is a rare privilege,
//child. Lord Voldemort does not usually negotiate for what he wants.”

// 18107
//Some part of Harry’s mind scrabbled frantically, looking for something,
//anything that might be of more value to Lord Voldemort or Professor Quirrell
//than child hostages or Severus’s death.

// 18108
//Another part of him, the part that had never stopped thinking, already knew his
//answer.

// 18109
//“You already have an idea for what you want from me,” Harry said, through the
//sickness and the bleeding wounds in his soul. “What is it?”

// 18110
//“Your help in obtaining the Philosopher’s Stone.”

// 18111
//Harry swallowed. He couldn’t stop his eyes from going to the gun, then back up
//at Professor Quirrell’s face.

// 18112
//He was aware that the hero in a storybook was supposed to say ‘No’, but now
//that he was actually in a situation like this, saying ‘No’ didn’t seem to make
//sense.

// 18113
//“I am disappointed that you need to think about this,” said Professor Quirrell.
//“It is straightforward that you should obey me for now, since I hold every
//advantage over you. I have taught you better than this; in this situation you
//should certainly pretend to lose. You can expect to gain nothing by resisting,
//except pain. You should have calculated that it was better to answer sooner,
//and not earn my distrust.” Professor Quirrell’s eyes studied him curiously.
//“Perhaps Dumbledore has filled your ears with nonsense about noble defiance? I
//find such morals amusing, since they are so easy to manipulate. I assure you
//that I can make defiance seem morally worse, and you would be well advised to
//submit before I demonstrate how.” The gun stayed pointed at Harry; but with a
//wave of Professor Quirrell’s other hand, Tracey Davis rose up into the air,
//spun lazily, her limbs stretched out spreadeagle -

// 18114
//- then, even as new adrenaline hammered at Harry’s heart, Tracey floated back
  //down again.

// 18115
//“Choose,” said Professor Quirrell. “This begins to try my patience.”

// 18116
//__I should have spoken just then, before he might’ve ripped off Tracey’s
//legs, no, I shouldn’t have, the Headmaster said I mustn’t show Lord Voldemort
//that I’ll do things if he threatens my friends because that will just make him
//threaten more of them - only what he said before isn’t a __threat __it’s
//just the sort of thing Lord Voldemort __does -

// 18117
//Harry took a deep breath, several of them. Whatever part of him kept on running
//on full automatic was screaming at the remainder of his mind that it
//__could not afford to stay in shock.__ Shocks were of finite duration,
//neurons kept firing regardless, the only reason Harry’s mind would shut down
//while his brain kept running was if Harry’s self-model __believed__ his
//mind would shut down -

// 18118
//“I don’t mean to try your patience,” Harry said. His voice was cracking. That
//was good. Sounding like he was still in shock meant that Lord Voldemort might
//give him more time. “But if Lord Voldemort had a reputation for keeping his
//bargains, I don’t know about it.”

// 18119
//“An obvious concern,” Professor Quirrell said. “There is a simple answer, and I
//would have enforced it upon you in any case. __Ssnakes can’t lie__. And
//since I have a tremendous distaste for stupidity, I suggest you do not say
//anything like ‘What do you mean?’ You are smarter than that, and I do not have
//time for such conversations as ordinary people inflict on one another.”

// 18120
//Harry swallowed. Snakes can’t lie. “__Two pluss two equalss four.__” Harry
//had tried to say that two plus two equalled three, and the word __four__
//had slipped out instead.

// 18121
//“Good. When Salazar Slytherin invoked the Parselmouth curse upon himself and
//all his children, his true plan was to ensure his descendants could trust one
//another’s words, whatever plots they wove against outsiders.” Professor
//Quirrell had adopted his lecturing pose from Battle Magic, like someone putting
//on a well-worn mask, but the gun remained pointed in his hand. “Occlumency
//cannot fool the Parselmouth curse as it can fool Veritaserum, and you may put
//that to the trial also. Now listen well. __Come with me, promisse your
//besst aid in getting Sstone, and I sshall leave thesse children behind
//unharmed. Hosstagess are real, hundredss of sstudentss die tonight unlesss I
//sstop eventss already sset in motion. Will sspare hosstagess if I obtain Sstone
//ssuccessfully.__ And mark also this, mark it well: __I cannot be truly
//sslain by any means known to me, and lossing Sstone will not sstop me from
//returning, nor sspare you or yourss my wrath.__ Any impetuous act you are
//contemplating cannot win the game for you, boy. I do credit your ability to
//annoy me, and suggest you avoid doing so.”

// 18122
//“You said,” Harry’s voice was strange in his own ears, “that the Philosopher’s
//Stone had different powers from what legend said. You said that to me in
//Parseltongue. Tell me what the Stone really does, before I agree to help you
//get it.” If it was something along the lines of gaining total power over the
//universe, then __nothing__ was worth an incrementally greater chance of
//Lord Voldemort getting the Stone.

// 18123
//“Ah,” said Professor Quirrell, and smiled. “You are thinking. That is better,
//and as a reward I shall offer you a further incentive for cooperation. Eternal
//life and youth, the creation of gold and silver. Suppose these are true
//benefits of holding the Stone. Tell me, boy. What is the Stone’s power?”

// 18124
//It might have been the adrenaline still in him, being actually useful for his
//brain for once. It might have been the power of being told that an answer
//existed, and that the evidence wasn’t a lie. “It can make Transfigurations
//permanent.”

// 18125
//Then Harry stopped, as he heard what his own mouth had just said.

// 18126
//“Correct,” said Professor Quirrell. “Thus, whoever holds the Philosopher’s
//Stone is able to perform human Transfiguration.”

// 18127
//Harry’s torn mind was knocked about yet again, as he realized what further
//incentive would be offered him.

// 18128
//“You stole Miss Granger’s remains and Transfigured them into some
//innocuous-appearing target,” said Professor Quirrell. “A Transfigured target
//that you must keep somewhere about your own person, in order to sustain the
//Transfiguration. Ah, I see your eyes going to that ring upon your hand, but of
//course Miss Granger would not be the little jewel set into the ring, would it?
//That would be too obvious. No, I expect you Transfigured Granger’s remains into
//the ring itself, letting the aura of the Transfigured jewel mask the magic in
//the Transfigured ring.”

// 18129
//“Yes,” Harry said, forcing out the word. It was a lie, for once, and Harry’s
//glance had been deliberate. Harry had expected someone to challenge him on the
//steel ring, he’d tried to provoke that challenge so he could prove to be
//innocent yet again, though nobody had taken him up on it - maybe Dumbledore had
//just sensed that the steel by itself wasn’t magical.

// 18130
//“Fine and good,” said Professor Quirrell. “Now come with me, help me to obtain
//the Stone, and I will resurrect Hermione Granger on your behalf. Her death has
//had unfortunate effects on you, and I would not mind undoing them. That, as I
//understand you, is your greatest desire. I have done you many kindnesses, and I
//would not mind doing you this one more.” A blank-eyed Professor Sprout had now
//risen from the ground and was pointing her own wand at Harry. “__Help me
//obtain Sstone of Transsfiguration, and I sshall try my hardesst to ressurrect
//your girl-child friend to true and lassting life. That ssaid, boy, I am
//sswiftly running out of patience with you, and you sshall not like what comess
//next.__” This last line was hissed out in a voice that conveyed the impression
//of a snake rearing its head to strike.

// 18131
//Even then.

// 18132
//Even then, with all the world upturned, with shock after shock, even then
//Harry’s brain did not stop being a brain, or completing the patterns its
//circuits had been wired to complete.

// 18133
//Harry knew that this was too good an offer to make to someone at whom you were
//pointing a gun.

// 18134
//Unless you __desperately__ needed their help to get the Philosopher’s
//Stone out of the magic mirror.

// 18135
//And there wasn’t any time left to plan, only the thought that, if Professor
//Quirrell really was going this far to get his help - what Harry __wanted__
//was to demand Professor Quirrell promise not to kill anyone in the future in
//exchange for his help now, but Harry had a strong sense that Professor Quirrell
//would reply ‘Don’t be ridiculous’ and there wasn’t time for ordinary
//conversation Harry had to guess the highest safe request in advance -

// 18136
//Professor Quirrell’s eyes narrowed, his lips parted -

// 18137
//“If I help you,” Harry’s mouth said, “I want your promise that you aren’t
//planning to turn on me when this is over. I want you to not kill Professor
//Snape or anyone else in Hogwarts for at least a week. And I want answers, the
//truth about everything that’s been going on this whole time, everything you
//know about my nature.”

// 18138
//The pale blue eyes regarded him dispassionately.

// 18139
//__I really think we could have thought of something better to ask for
//than that,__ said Harry’s Slytherin side. __But I suppose we were
//legitimately out of time, and whatever we need to do next, answers will help.__

// 18140
//Harry wasn’t listening to that voice right now. Cold chills were still going
//down his spine from hearing the words that had just come out of his lips,
//addressed to the man with the gun.

// 18141
//“That is your condition for helping me to obtain the Stone?” said Professor
//Quirrell.

// 18142
//Harry nodded, unable to form words.

// 18143
//__“Agreed,__” hissed Professor Quirrell. ”__Help me, and you sshall
//have ansswerss to your quesstions, sso long ass they are about passt eventss,
//and not my planss for the future. I do not intend to raisse my hand or magic
//againsst you in future, sso long ass you do not raisse your hand or magic
//againsst me. Sshall kill none within sschool groundss for a week, unlesss I
//musst. Now promisse that you will not attempt to warn againsst me or esscape.
//Promisse to put forth your own besst efforts toward helping me to obtain the
//Sstone. And your girl-child friend sshall be revived by me, to true life and
//health; nor sshall me or mine ever sseek to harm her.__” A twisted smile.
//”__Promisse, boy, and the bargain will be sstruck.”__

// 18144
//“I promise,” whispered Harry.

// 18145
//__WHAT?__ screamed other parts of his mind.

// 18146
//__Um, he’s still pointing a gun at us,__ pointed out Slytherin. __We
//don’t actually have a choice, we’re just getting as much mileage out of this as
//possible.__

// 18147
//__You bastard,__ said Hufflepuff. __Do you think this is what
//Hermione would have wanted? This is Lord Voldemort we’re talking about, do we
//even know how many people he’s killed, and will kill?__

// 18148
//__I deny that we are compromising with Lord Voldemort for Hermione’s
//sake,__ said Slytherin. __Since there is, in fact, a gun and we can’t
//otherwise stop him. Also, Mum and Dad would want us to just go along and stay
//safe.__

// 18149
//Professor Quirrell regarded him steadily. “Repeat the full promise in
//Parseltongue, boy.”

// 18150
//“__I sshall help you obtain the Sstone… I cannot promisse I will usse my
//besst efforts, my heart will not be in it, I fear. I intend to try. Sshall not
//do anything I think will annoy you to no good end. Sshall call no help if I
//expect them to be killed by you or for hosstagess to die. I’m ssorry, teacher,
//but it iss besst I can do.”__ Harry’s mind was settling, composing itself, as
//the decision was made. He would stay with Professor Quirrell, go with him to
//get the Stone, save the student hostages, and… and… and Harry didn’t know,
//except that he’d go on thinking.

// 18151
//“You actually are sorry about that?” Professor Quirrell looked amused. “I
//suppose it shall have to do. Then keep two other things in mind: __I have
//plan to sstop even sschoolmasster, if he appearss before uss.__ And also this: I
//will occasionally ask you to say in Parseltongue whether you have betrayed me.
//__The bargain is sstruck.__”

// 18152
//After that, Professor Sprout picked up Harry’s wand, and wrapped it in
//shimmering cloth; then she placed it on the floor, and again pointed her wand
//at Harry. Only then did Professor Quirrell lower his gun, which seemed to
//disappear into his hand, and pick up Harry’s wrapped wand, tucking it into his
//robes.

// 18153
//The True Cloak of Invisibility was removed from the sleeping form of Lesath
//Lestrange, and Professor Quirrell took the Cloak, as well as Harry’s pouch and
//Time-Turner.

// 18154
//Then Professor Quirrell cast a mass Obliviation followed by the mass version of
//the False Memory Charm, the one that just had the subject fill in the blanks
//using their own suggestibility, on all the students present. Afterwards
//Professor Sprout floated away the sleeping children, now wearing an expression
//that seemed annoyed and preoccupied, as if they’d been in some Herbology
//accident.

// 18155
//Professor Quirrell then turned back to where the Potions Master lay sprawled,
//bent over and placed his wand on Professor Snape’s forehead. __“Alienis
//nervus mobile lignum.”__

// 18156
//The Defense Professor stepped back, and began to move his left fingers in the
//air as though manipulating a puppet on strings.

// 18157
//Professor Snape pushed himself up from the ground by smooth motions, and stood
//once more before the corridor door.

// 18158
//“__Alohomora,__” Professor Quirrell said, pointing his wand at the
//forbidden door. The Defense Professor looked rather amused. “Would you do the
//honors, boy?”

// 18159
//Harry swallowed. He was once again having second thoughts, and third thoughts.

// 18160
//It was strange how you could do something even while knowing it was the wrong
//thing, not the selfish thing but the __wrong thing to do__ on some deeper
//level.

// 18161
//But the man behind him was holding the gun; it had once more appeared in his
//hand at Harry’s hesitation.

// 18162
//Harry laid his hand on the door-knocker, and took several deep breaths, again
//composing his mind as best he could. Go through with it, don’t get shot, don’t
//let the hostages die, be there to optimize events, be there to watch for
//opportunities and stay capable of taking them. It wasn’t a good choice, but all
//the other ones seemed worse.

// 18163
//Harry pushed open the forbidden door, and stepped through.

// 18164
//__The next (short) chapter will post on **February 17th, 2015** at
