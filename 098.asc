//__Sunday, April 19th, 6:34pm.__

// 17227
//Daphne Greengrass walked quietly toward the Greengrass room below the Slytherin
//dungeons, the privilege of an Ancient House; on her way to drop off her trunk
//from the Hogwarts Express, before she joined the other students for dinner. The
//whole private area had been hers alone ever since Malfoy had gone. Her hand,
//held behind her, made repeated come-along gestures at her huge emerald-studded
//trunk, which seemed hesitant to follow. Maybe the enchantments on the sturdy
//old family device needed to be reapplied; or maybe her trunk was reluctant to
//follow her into Hogwarts, which was no longer safe.

// 17228
//There’d been a long talk between Mother and Father, after they’d been told
//about Hermione; with Daphne hiding around a doorway to listen, choking back her
//tears and trying not to make sounds.

// 17229
//Mother had said that the sad fact was that if only one student died every year,
//well, that still made Hogwarts safer than Beauxbatons, let alone Durmstrang.
//There were more ways for a young witch to die than being murdered.
//Beauxbatons’s Transfiguration Master just wasn’t on the same level as
//McGonagall, Mother had said.

// 17230
//Father had soberly remarked how important it was for the Greengrass heir to
//stay at Hogwarts where all the other Noble families sent their children to
//school (it was the reason for the old tradition of the Noble families
//synchronizing the birth of their heirs, to put them in the same year of
//Hogwarts, if they could). And Father had said that being heiress to a Most
//Ancient House meant you couldn’t always stay away from trouble.

// 17231
//She could have done without hearing that last part.

// 17232
//Daphne gulped hard, as she turned the doorknob, and opened the door.

// 17233
//“Miss Greengrass -” whispered a shadowy, silvery-robed figure.

// 17234
//Daphne screamed and slammed the door and drew her wand and turned to run.

// 17235
//“Wait!” cried the voice, now higher and louder.

// 17236
//Daphne paused. That couldn’t __possibly__ be who it had sounded like.

// 17237
//Slowly, Daphne turned, and opened the door again.

// 17238
//__“You!”__ Daphne said in astonishment, as she saw the face beneath the
//hood. “I thought you were -”

// 17239
//“I come back to you now,” the silvery-robed figure said in a strong voice, “at
//the turn of the -”

// 17240
//“__What are you doing in my bedroom?__” shrieked Daphne.

// 17241
//“I heard you can cast the mist form of the Patronus Charm. Can I see?”

// 17242
//Daphne stared, and then her blood began to burn. “Why?” she said, keeping her
//wand level. “So you can __kill__ everyone in Slytherin who casts
//un-Slytherin spells? We all __know__ who it was had Hermione killed!”

// 17243
//The figure’s voice rose. “I testified under Veritaserum that I tried to help
//Miss Granger! I really was trying to help her, when I grabbed her hand on the
//roof, when I helped her off the floor -”

// 17244
//Daphne kept her wand level. “Like your father couldn’t tamper with the Aurors’
//record, if he wanted to! I wasn’t born yesterday, Mister __Malfoy!__”

// 17245
//Slowly, as if not to cause alarm, the silver-robed figure drew a wand from his
//robes. Daphne’s hand tightened on her own wand, but then she recognized the
//position of the fingers on the wand, the stance the figure was assuming, and
//she drew a shocked breath -

// 17246
//__“Expecto Patronum!__”

// 17247
//Silver light leapt from the end of the other’s wand - and condensed, forming a
//shining serpent that seemed to coil in the air as though nesting there.

// 17248
//She just gaped.

// 17249
//“I __did__ try to help Hermione Granger,” Draco Malfoy said with a level
//voice. “Because I know the sickness at the heart of Slytherin’s House, the
//reason why so many of us can’t cast the Patronus Charm any more, is hate. Hate
//of Muggleborns, or just anyone really. People think that’s all Slytherin is
//about now, not cunning or ambition or honorable nobility. And I even know,
//because it’s obvious if you just look, that Hermione Granger wasn’t weak at
//magic.”

// 17250
//Daphne’s mind had gone completely blank. Her eyes darted around nervously, just
//to check that there wasn’t blood coming from under the doors, like the last
//time Something had Broken.

// 17251
//“And I’ve also figured out,” Draco Malfoy said quietly, as the silver snake
//went on shining with unmistakeable light and warmth, “that Hermione Granger
//never really tried to kill me. Maybe she was False-Memory-Charmed, maybe she
//was Legilimized, but now that she’s been murdered, it’s obvious that Miss
//Granger was the target in the first place, when somebody tried to set her up
//for murdering me -”

// 17252
//“D-do-do you know what you’re __saying?__” Daphne’s voice broke. If Lucius
//Malfoy heard his heir saying that - he’d __skin__ Draco and turn him into
//__trousers!__

// 17253
//Draco Malfoy smiled, metallic robes gleaming in the light of his full corporeal
//Patronus; it was a smile both arrogant and dangerous, like being turned into a
//pair of leather pants was beneath his concerns. “Yes,” said Draco, “but it
//doesn’t matter now. House Malfoy is returning House Potter’s money and
//cancelling the debt.”

// 17254
//Daphne walked over to her bed and then fell on it, hoping she could wake up
//from the dream once she was in bed.

// 17255
//“I’d like you to join a conspiracy,” said the figure in the shining robes.
//“Everyone in Slytherin who can cast the Patronus Charm, and everyone who can
//learn. That’s how we’ll know to trust each other, when the Silvery Slytherins
//meet.” With a dramatic gesture, Draco Malfoy cast back his hood. “But it won’t
//work without __you, __Daphne Greengrass. You and your family. Your mother
//will negotiate it with Father, but I’d like the Greengrasses to hear the
//proposal from you, first.” Draco Malfoy’s voice lowered grimly. “There is much
//we must speak of, before we eat dinner.”

// 17256
//Harry Potter had, apparently, taken to being invisible; they’d glimpsed his
//hand only briefly, when he was handing them the list, written on strange
//not-parchment. Harry had explained that, all things considered, he didn’t
//really think it was smart for him to be __findable__ except on special
//occasions, so he was just going to deal with people as a disembodied floating
//voice from now on, or as a brilliant silver light that hid behind corners where
//nobody could see it, and which could always find his friends no matter where
//they tried to hide. It was, in all honesty, one of the creepiest things which
//Fred and George had ever heard, over a lifetime which had included filling the
//shoes of every student in second-year Slytherin with Transfigured live
//millipedes. Fred and George didn’t think this could possibly be good for
//anyone’s sanity, but they didn’t know what to say. It couldn’t be denied,
//they’d seen with their own four eyes, that Hogwarts…

// 17257
//…wasn’t safe…

// 17258
//“I don’t know who you went to for the False Memory Charm on Rita Skeeter,” said
//the sourceless voice of Harry Potter. “Whoever it is… probably __won’t__
//be able to fill this order directly, but they may know someone who can get
//things from the Muggle world. And - I know it may cost extra, but as few people
//as possible should know that Harry Potter is related to this.” Another flash of
//a small boy’s hand, and a bag hit the ground with the clinking noise. “Some of
//these items are expensive even in the Muggle world, and your contact may have
//to go outside Britain; but one hundred Galleons will be enough to pay for it
//all, I hope. I’d tell you where the Galleons came from, but I don’t want to
//spoil tomorrow’s surprise.”

// 17259
//“What __is__ this stuff?” said Fred or George, as they looked over the
//list. “Our father is a Muggle expert -”

// 17260
//“- and we don’t recognize __half__ this stuff -”

// 17261
//“- why, we don’t recognize any of it -”

// 17262
//“- just what are you planning to __do?__”

// 17263
//“Things have become serious,” Harry’s voice said softly. “I don’t know what
//I’ll have to do. I may need the power of the Muggles, not just the wizards,
//before this is done - and I might need it right away, with no time to prepare.
//I’m not __planning__ to use any of this. I just want it around in case of…
//contingencies.” Harry’s voice paused. “Obviously I owe you more than I can ever
//repay and you won’t __let__ me give you __any__ of what you deserve,
//I don’t even know how to say thank you properly, and all I can do is hope that
//someday when you grow up you’ll be more sensible about this whole thing and
//would you __please__ take a ten percent commission -”

// 17264
//“Shut up, you,” said George or Fred.

// 17265
//“For God’s sake, you went after a troll for me and Fred had his ribs broken!”

// 17266
//They both just shook their heads. Harry had stayed behind when they’d told him
//to run, and stepped forward to distract the troll from eating George. Harry was
//the kind of person, they knew, who’d think that something like that didn’t
//cancel out what he owed the Weasley twins, that his own deed wasn’t properly
//commensurate. But what the Weasleys knew, and Harry wouldn’t understand until
//he was older, was that it meant that nothing was owed, or ever could be owed
//between them. It was a strange kind of selfishness, they thought, that Harry
//could understand kindness within himself - never dreaming of asking of money
//from anyone he’d helped more than they’d helped him, or calling that a debt -
//while being apparently unable to conceive that others might want to act the
//same way toward __him__.

// 17267
//“Remind me to buy you a copy of the Muggle novel __Atlas Shrugged,__” the
//sourceless voice said. “I’m starting to understand what sort of person can
//benefit from reading it.”

// 17268
//__Monday, April 20th, 7:00pm.__

// 17269
//It happened without any intervention or sign from the Head Table, as the
//students had finished their subdued dinner; it happened with no permission or
//forgiveness asked from the Professors or the Headmaster.

// 17270
//Shortly after the dessert dishes had appeared, a student stood up from the
//Slytherin Table and calmly made his way, not to the front of the Head Table,
//but toward the opposite side of the Four Tables of Hogwarts. A few whispers
//broke out at the sight of the white-blonde short-cropped hair, as Draco Malfoy
//stood there, silently regarding all of Hogwarts. Draco Malfoy had said almost
//nothing since his surprise return. The Slytherin had condescended neither to
//confirm nor deny that he had returned because, with Hermione Granger dead at
//his family’s hand, he no longer had anything to fear.

// 17271
//Then Draco Malfoy took up a spoon in one hand, and a glass of water in the
//other, and began tapping, producing a clear ringing sound.

// 17272
//__Ting.__

// 17273
//__Ting.__

// 17274
//__Ting.__

// 17275
//It produced more excited babble at first. At the Head Table, the various
//Professors looked in puzzlement toward the Headmaster in his great chair, but
//the Headmaster gave no sign, and so the faculty did nothing.

// 17276
//Draco Malfoy continued tapping the spoon upon his glass, until the room fell
//silent, waiting.

// 17277
//Then another student arose from the Ravenclaw table, and made his way to where
//Draco Malfoy was standing, turning to face Hogwarts at his side. Breaths were
//drawn in surprise; those two should have been the bitterest of enemies -

// 17278
//“I, and my Father, the Lord of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy,”
//Draco Malfoy said in a clear voice, “have come to realize that there are ill
//forces at work in Hogwarts. That these ill forces, did wish Hermione Granger
//harm. That Hermione Granger was perhaps compelled, against her will, to raise
//her hand against our House; or perhaps she and I were both Memory-Charmed. We
//now say that whoever dared use the heir of Malfoy so, is the enemy of House
//Malfoy, upon whom we shall have our vengeance. And that honor be served, we
//have returned all moneys taken from House Potter, and canceled all debt.”

// 17279
//Then Harry Potter spoke. “House Potter acknowledges that it was an honest
//mistake, and holds House Malfoy no ill will. We believe and publicly say that
//House Malfoy was not at fault in Hermione Granger’s death. Whoever harmed
//Hermione Granger is the enemy of House Potter, upon whom we shall have our
//vengeance. Both of us.”

// 17280
//Then Harry Potter began to walk back to the Ravenclaw table, and the babble of
//sheer, utter, reality-crashing bewilderment began to explode -

// 17281
//Draco Malfoy resumed tapping his spoon against his waterglass, creating a clear
//ringing chime.

// 17282
//__Ting.__

// 17283
//__Ting.__

// 17284
//__Ting.__

// 17285
//And other students arose, from other tables, making their way to where Draco
//Malfoy stood, arranging themselves at his side, or behind him, or before him.

// 17286
//There was a dread silence in the Great Hall, a sense of the world shifting, of
//realigning Powers, almost tangible in the air.

// 17287
//“My father, Owen Greengrass, with the consent and full backing of my mother,
//the Lady of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Greengrass,” Daphne Greengrass
//spoke.

// 17288
//“And my forefather, Charles, of the House of Nott,” said the former Lieutenant
//Nott, once Theodore of Chaos, now standing behind Draco Malfoy.

// 17289
//“And my grand-aunt, Amelia, of the House of Bones, also Director of the
//Department of Magical Law Enforcement,” said Susan Bones, who stood anext
//Daphne Greengrass, beside whom she had fought.

// 17290
//“And my grandmother, Augusta, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of
//Longbottom,” said Neville Longbottom, who had returned for this one night.

// 17291
//“And my father, Lucius, the Lord Malfoy, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of
//Malfoy!”

// 17292
//“Together with Alanna Howe constituting a majority of the Hogwarts Board of
//Governors!” Daphne Greengrass said clearly. “Have, to ensure the safety of all
//students, including their own children, passed the following Educational
//Decrees upon the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!”

// 17293
//“First!” Daphne said. Daphne was trying to keep her trembling under control, as
//she faced the Four Houses at the forefront of the five. There was only so far
//her parents’ lessons in speech-making could take her. Daphne’s eyes darted down
//quickly to her hand, upon which, written with a quill in faint red ink, cues to
//her lines had been written. “Students are not to go anywhere alone, not even to
//the toilets! You will travel in groups of at least three, and every group must
//have a sixth-year or seventh-year student!”

// 17294
//“Second!” Susan Bones said from behind her, voice almost firm. “To further
//ensure the students’ safety, nine Aurors have been dispatched to Hogwarts to
//form an Auxiliary Protective Force!” Susan took a small, round glass object
//from within her robes, one of the communicators that the DMLE used, which
//they’d all been given. Susan raised it to her mouth and said, her voice now
//higher, “Auror Brodski, this is Susan Bones. __Enter!__”

// 17295
//The doors to the Hall slammed open, and in marched nine Aurors in the
//reinforced leather gear they used when on duty. At once they spread out, two
//Aurors taking up station by each of the four tables, and the last took up watch
//at the Head Table. There were more gasps.

// 17296
//“Third!” said Draco Malfoy, his voice commanding. Malfoy had apparently
//memorized his own lines, since there was nothing written on his hand that
//Daphne could see. “In the face of a common enemy who does not balk at killing
//students from any House, the four Houses of Hogwarts must come together and act
//as one! To emphasize this, the House Points system is temporarily suspended!
//__All__ Professors will encourage solidarity between Houses, by decree of
//the Hogwarts Board of Governors!”

// 17297
//“Fourth!” recited Neville Longbottom. “All students not already in the Defense
//Professor’s after-school classes, will receive special training in self-defense
//by Auror instructors!”

// 17298
//“Fifth!” Theodore Nott yelled in a menacing tone. “All fighting in the
//corridors or anywhere outside of Defense lessons will be dealt with severely!
//Fight together or don’t fight at all!”

// 17299
//“Sixth!” said Daphne Greengrass, and took a deep breath. When she’d found out
//what was planned, she’d made her own little extra request to Mother through the
//Floo. Even with Lucius Malfoy going along with Amelia Bones - a thought her
//mind was still having trouble grasping - the Greengrass swing vote had still
//been vital, since Jugson and his own faction had refused to back Malfoy. Not to
//mention that Bones didn’t trust Malfoy, and Malfoy didn’t trust Bones. So
//Mother had demanded, and the Greengrasses had received - “Since Memory Charms
//have been used on students without setting off wards, it is possible that
//someone on the Hogwarts faculty may be implicated. Therefore! The Auxiliary
//Protective force reports directly to my father, Lord Greengrass!” And this part
//was only symbolic, she knew, there’d be no reason anyone wouldn’t just contact
//the Aurors directly; but it might turn into more, someday, which was why she’d
//asked Mother to demand it - “And if anyone wants to report something to the
//Auxiliary Protectors, they can talk to the Aurors, or go through __me__ -”
//Daphne’s arm swept behind her to indicate the gathered students. “The duly
//appointed President of the Auxiliary Protective Special Committee!”

// 17300
//And Daphne paused dramatically. They’d all rehearsed this part.

// 17301
//“We don’t know who the enemy is,” said Neville, whose voice did not squeak.

// 17302
//“We don’t know what the enemy wants,” said Theodore, still looking menacing.

// 17303
//“But we know who the enemy is attacking,” said Susan, as fierce as when she’d
//taken on three seventh-year students.

// 17304
//“The enemy is attacking Hogwarts students,” said Draco Malfoy, clear and
//commanding, like all this was his natural element.

// 17305
//“And Hogwarts,” spoke Daphne of Greengrass, feeling her blood burn like it
//never had before in her life, “is going to __fight back.”__
