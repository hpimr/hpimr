//== Humanism, Pt 3

// 8227
//Fawkes’s song gently trailed off into nothing.

// 8228
//Harry sat up from where he had lain on the winter-blasted grass, Fawkes still
//perched on his shoulder.

// 8229
//There were intakes of breath from all around him.

// 8230
//“Harry,” said Seamus in a wavering voice, “are you all right?”

// 8231
//The peace of the phoenix was still in him, and warmth, from where Fawkes
//perched. Warmth, spreading out through him, and the memory of the song, still
//alive in the phoenix’s presence. There were terrible things that had happened
//to him, terrible thoughts that had passed through him. He had regained an
//impossible memory, for all that the Dementor had made him desecrate it. A
//strange word kept echoing in his mind. And all of that could be put on hold for
//later, while the phoenix still shone red and gold beneath the setting sun.

// 8232
//Fawkes cawed at him.

// 8233
//“Something I have to do?” Harry said to Fawkes. “What?”

// 8234
//Fawkes bobbed its head in the direction of the Dementor.

// 8235
//Harry looked at the unseeable horror still in its cage, then back at the
//phoenix, puzzled.

// 8236
//“Mr. Potter?” said Minerva McGonagall’s voice from behind him. “__Are__
//you all right?”

// 8237
//Harry climbed to his feet and turned.

// 8238
//Minerva McGonagall was looking at him, looking very worried; Albus Dumbledore
//beside her was studying him carefully; Filius Flitwick appeared tremendously
//relieved; and all the students were just plain staring.

// 8239
//“I think so, Professor McGonagall,” Harry said calmly. He’d almost said
//__Minerva__ before managing to stop himself. While Fawkes was on his
//shoulder, at least, Harry was fine; it might be that he would collapse a moment
//after Fawkes left, but somehow thoughts like that didn’t seem important. “I
//think I’m okay.”

// 8240
//There ought to have been cheering, or sighs of relief, or something, but no one
//seemed to know what to say, no one at all.

// 8241
//The peace of the phoenix lingered.

// 8242
//Harry turned back. “Hermione?” he said.

// 8243
//Everyone with the tiniest smidgin of romance in their hearts held their breath.

// 8244
//“I don’t really know how to say thank you graciously,” Harry said quietly, “any
//more than I know how to apologize. All I can say that if you’re wondering
//whether it was the right thing to do, it was.”

// 8245
//The boy and the girl gazed into each other’s eyes.

// 8246
//“Sorry,” Harry said. “About what happens next. If there’s anything I can do -”

// 8247
//“No,” Hermione said back. “There isn’t. It’s all right, though.” Then she
//turned from Harry and walked away, toward the path that led back to the gates
//of Hogwarts.

// 8248
//A number of girls gave Harry puzzled looks, and then followed her. As they
//went, you could hear the excited questions starting.

// 8249
//Harry looked at them as they left, turned back to look at the other students.
//They’d seen him on the ground, screaming, and…

// 8250
//Fawkes nuzzled his cheek, briefly.

// 8251
//…and that would help them, someday, understanding that the Boy-Who-Lived could
//also be hurt, could be wretched. So that when they were hurt and wretched
//themselves, they would remember seeing Harry writhing on the ground, and know
//that their own pain and troubles didn’t mean they’d never amount to anything.
//Had the Headmaster calculated that, when he had let the other students stay and
//watch?

// 8252
//Harry’s eyes went back to the tall tattered cloak, almost absentmindedly, and
//without really being aware of what he was speaking, Harry said, “It shouldn’t
//ought to exist.”

// 8253
//“Ah,” said a dry, precise voice. “I thought you might say that. I am very sorry
//to tell you, Mr. Potter, that Dementors cannot be killed. Many have tried.”

// 8254
//“Really?” Harry said, still absentmindedly. “What did they try?”

// 8255
//“There is a certain extremely dangerous and destructive spell,” Professor
//Quirrell said, “which I will not name here; a spell of cursed fire. It is what
//you would use to destroy an ancient device such as the Sorting Hat. It has no
//effect on Dementors. They are undying.”

// 8256
//“They are not undying,” said the Headmaster. The words mild, the gaze sharp.
//“They do not possess eternal life. They are wounds in the world, and attacking
//a wound only makes it larger.”

// 8257
//“Hm,” Harry said. “Suppose you threw it into the Sun? Would it be destroyed?”

// 8258
//“__Throw__ it into the __Sun?__” squeaked Professor Flitwick, looking
//like he wanted to faint.

// 8259
//“It seems unlikely, Mr. Potter,” Professor Quirrell said dryly. “The Sun is
//very large, after all; I doubt the Dementor would have much effect on it. But
//it is not a test I would like to try, Mr. Potter, just in case.”

// 8260
//“I see,” Harry said.

// 8261
//Fawkes cawed a final time, mantled his wings around Harry’s head, and then
//launched himself from Harry. Launched himself straight toward the Dementor,
//screaming a great piercing cry of defiance that echoed around the field. And
//before anyone could react to that, there was a flash of fire, and Fawkes was
//gone.

// 8262
//The peace faded, a little.

// 8263
//The warmth faded, a little.

// 8264
//Harry took in a deep breath, let it out again.

// 8265
//“Yep,” Harry said. “Still alive.”

// 8266
//Again that silence, again the absence of cheering; no one seemed to know how to
//respond -

// 8267
//“It is good to know you are fully recovered, Mr. Potter,” Professor Quirrell
//said firmly, as though to deny any other possibility. “Now, I believe Miss
//Ransom was up next?”

// 8268
//That started a bit of an argument, in which Professor Quirrell was right and
//everyone else was wrong. The Defense Professor pointed out that, despite the
//understandable emotions of all concerned, the chance of a similar mishap
//occurring to any other student verged on the infinitesimal; the more so as they
//now knew to avoid mischances with wands. And meanwhile, there were other
//students who needed to take their own best chance at casting a corporeal
//Patronus Charm, or else learn the feeling of a Dementor so they could flee, and
//discover their own degree of vulnerability…

// 8269
//In the end it turned out that Dean Thomas and Ron Weasley of Gryffindor were
//the only ones left who were still willing to go anywhere near the Dementor,
//which simplified the argument.

// 8270
//Harry glanced in the Dementor’s direction. The word echoed in his mind again.

// 8271
//__All right,__ Harry thought to himself, __if the Dementor is a
//riddle, what is the answer?__

// 8272
//And just like that, it was obvious.

// 8273
//Harry looked at the tarnished, slightly corroded cage.

// 8274
//He saw what lay beneath the tall, tattered cloak.

// 8275
//That was it, then.

// 8276
//Professor McGonagall came and spoke to Harry. She hadn’t seen the worst of it,
//so there was only a slight glitter of water in her eyes. Harry told her that he
//needed to talk to her afterward and ask a question he’d put off for a while,
//but that didn’t need to happen right now, if she was busy. There was a certain
//look about her which suggested that she had been pulled away from something
//important; and Harry observed this to her, and said that she honestly didn’t
//need to feel guilty about leaving. This earned him something of a sharp look,
//but then leave she did, hurriedly, with a promise that they would talk later.

// 8277
//Dean Thomas cast his white bear again, even in the Dementor’s presence; and Ron
//Weasley put up an adequate shield of sparkling mist. Which concluded the day,
//so far as everyone else was concerned, and Professor Flitwick began to herd the
//students back to Hogwarts. When it was clear that Harry meant to stay behind,
//Professor Flitwick looked at him quizzically; and Harry, for his part, glanced
//significantly at Dumbledore. Harry didn’t know what Professor Flitwick made of
//that, but after a sharp gaze of warning, his Head of House departed.

// 8278
//And so remained only Harry, Professor Quirrell, Headmaster Dumbledore, and an
//Auror trio.

// 8279
//It would have been better to get rid of the trio first, but Harry couldn’t
//think of a good way to do that.

// 8280
//“All right,” said Auror Komodo, “let’s take it back.”

// 8281
//“Excuse me,” Harry said. “I’d like to have another go at the Dementor.”

// 8282
//Harry’s request met with a certain amount of opposition of the __you’re
//completely insane__ variety, though it was only Auror Butnaru who actually said
//that out loud.

// 8283
//“Fawkes told me to,” Harry said.

// 8284
//This did not overcome all the opposition, despite the look of shock it produced
//on Dumbledore’s face. The argument went on, and it was starting to wear the
//edges off the phoenix’s remaining peace, which annoyed Harry, though only a
//little.

// 8285
//“Look,” Harry said, “I’m pretty sure I know what I was doing wrong before.
//There’s a kind of person who has to use a different sort of warm and happy
//thought. Just let me try it, okay?”

// 8286
//This did not prove persuasive either.

// 8287
//“I think,” Professor Quirrell said finally, staring at Harry with narrowed
//eyes, “that if we do not allow him to do this under supervision, he may, at
//some point or another, sneak off and look for a Dementor on his own. Do I
//accuse you falsely, Mr. Potter?”

// 8288
//There was an appalled pause at this. It seemed like a good time to play his
//trump card.

// 8289
//“I don’t mind if the Headmaster keeps his own Patronus up,” Harry said.
//__For I will be in the presence of a Dementor just the same, Patronus or
//no.__

// 8290
//There was confusion at this, even Professor Quirrell looked puzzled; but the
//Headmaster finally acceded, since it didn’t seem likely that Harry could be
//hurt through four Patronuses.

// 8291
//__If the Dementor could not reach through your Patronus on some level,
//Albus Dumbledore, you would not see a naked man painful to look upon…__

// 8292
//Harry didn’t say it out loud, for obvious reasons.

// 8293
//And they began to walk toward the Dementor.

// 8294
//“Headmaster,” Harry said, “suppose the Ravenclaw door asked you this riddle:
//What lies at the center of a Dementor? What would you say?”

// 8295
//“Fear,” said the Headmaster.

// 8296
//It was a simple enough mistake. The Dementor approached, and the fear came over
//you. The fear hurt, you felt the fear weakening you, you wanted the fear to go
//away.

// 8297
//It was natural to think the fear was the problem.

// 8298
//So they’d concluded that the Dementor was a creature of pure fear, that there
//was nothing there to fear but fear itself, that the Dementor couldn’t hurt you
//if you weren’t afraid…

// 8299
//But…

// 8300
//__What lies at the center of a Dementor?__

// 8301
//__Fear.__

// 8302
//__What is so horrible that the mind refuses to see it?__

// 8303
//__Fear.__

// 8304
//__What is impossible to kill?__

// 8305
//__Fear.__

// 8306
//…it didn’t quite fit, once you thought about it.

// 8307
//Though it was clear enough why people would be reluctant to look beyond the
//first answer.

// 8308
//People __understood__ fear.

// 8309
//People knew what they were supposed to __do__ about fear.

// 8310
//So, faced with a Dementor, it wouldn’t exactly be comforting to ask: ‘What if
//the fear is just a side effect rather than the main problem?’

// 8311
//They had come very close to the Dementor’s cage guarded by four Patronuses,
//when there came sharp intakes of breath from the three Aurors and Professor
//Quirrell. Everyone’s faces turned to look at the Dementor, seeming to listen;
//there was horror on Auror Goryanof’s face.

// 8312
//Then Professor Quirrell raised his head, his face hard, and spat toward the
//Dementor.

// 8313
//“It did not like having its prey taken from it, I suppose,” Dumbledore said
//quietly. “Well. If it becomes necessary, Quirinus, there will always be a
//refuge for you at Hogwarts.”

// 8314
//“What did it say?” said Harry.

// 8315
//Every head swung to stare at him.

// 8316
//“You didn’t hear it…?” Dumbledore said.

// 8317
//Harry shook his head.

// 8318
//“It said to me,” said Professor Quirrell, “that it knew me, and that it would
//hunt me down someday, wherever I tried to hide.” His face was rigid, showing no
//fright.

// 8319
//“Ah,” Harry said. “I wouldn’t worry about that, Professor Quirrell.”
//__It’s not like Dementors can actually talk, or think; the structure they
//have is borrowed from your own mind and expectations…__

// 8320
//Now everyone was giving him __very__ strange looks. The Aurors were
//glancing nervously at each other, at the Dementor, at Harry.

// 8321
//And they stood directly before the Dementor’s cage.

// 8322
//“They are wounds in the world,” Harry said. “It’s just a wild guess, but I’m
//guessing the one who said that was Godric Gryffindor.”

// 8323
//“Yes…” said Dumbledore. “How did you know?”

// 8324
//__It is a common misconception__, thought Harry, __that all the best
//rationalists are Sorted into Ravenclaw, leaving none for other Houses. This is
//not so; being Sorted into Ravenclaw indicates that your strongest virtue is
//curiosity, wondering and desiring to know the true answer. And this is not the
//__only__ virtue a rationalist needs. Sometimes you have to work hard on a
//problem, and stick to it for a while. Sometimes you need a clever plan for
//finding out. And sometimes what you need more than anything else to see an
//answer, is the courage to face it…__

// 8325
//Harry’s gaze went to what lay beneath the cloak, the horror far worse than any
//decaying mummy. Rowena Ravenclaw might also have known, for it was an obvious
//enough riddle once you saw it as a riddle.

// 8326
//And it was also obvious why the Patronuses were animals. The animals didn’t
//know, and so were sheltered from the fear.

// 8327
//But Harry knew, and would always know, and would never be able to forget. He’d
//tried to teach himself to face reality without flinching, and though Harry had
//not yet mastered that art, still those grooves had been worn into his mind, the
//learned reflex to look __toward__ the painful thought instead of away.
//Harry would never be able to forget by thinking warm happy thoughts about
//something else, and that was why the spell hadn’t worked for him.

// 8328
//So Harry would think a warm happy thought that __wasn’t__ about something
//else.

// 8329
//Harry drew forth his wand that Professor Flitwick had returned to him, put his
//feet into the beginning stance for the Patronus Charm.

// 8330
//Within his mind, Harry discarded the last remnants of the peace of the phoenix,
//put aside the calm, the dreamlike state, remembered instead Fawkes’s piercing
//cry, and roused himself for battle. Called upon all the pieces and elements of
//himself to awaken. Raised up within himself all the strength that the Patronus
//Charm could ever draw upon, to put himself into the right frame of mind for the
//final warm and happy thought; remembered all bright things.

// 8331
//The books his father had bought him.

// 8332
//Mum’s smile when Harry had handmade her a mother’s day card, an elaborate thing
//that had used half a pound of spare electronics parts from the garage to flash
//lights and beep a little tune, and had taken him three days to make.

// 8333
//Professor McGonagall telling him that his parents had died well, protecting
//him. As they had.

// 8334
//Realizing that Hermione was keeping up with him and even running faster, that
//they could be true rivals and friends.

// 8335
//Coaxing Draco out of the darkness, watching him slowly move toward the light.

// 8336
//Neville and Seamus and Lavender and Dean and everyone else who looked up to
//him, everyone that he would have fought to protect if anything threatened
//Hogwarts.

// 8337
//Everything that made life worth living.

// 8338
//His wand rose into the starting position for the Patronus Charm.

// 8339
//Harry thought of the stars, the image that had almost held off the Dementor
//even without a Patronus. Only this time, Harry added the missing ingredient,
//he’d never truly seen it but he’d seen the pictures and the video. The Earth,
//blazing blue and white with reflected sunlight as it hung in space, amid the
//black void and the brilliant points of light. It belonged there, within that
//image, because it was what gave everything else its meaning. The Earth was what
//made the stars significant, made them more than uncontrolled fusion reactions,
//because it was Earth that would someday colonize the galaxy, and fulfill the
//promise of the night sky.

// 8340
//Would they still be plagued by Dementors, the children’s children’s children,
//the distant descendants of humankind as they strode from star to star? No. Of
//course not. The Dementors were only little nuisances, paling into nothingness
//in the light of that promise; not unkillable, not invincible, not even close.
//You had to put up with little nuisances, if you were one of the lucky and
//unlucky few to be born on Earth; on Ancient Earth, as it would be remembered
//someday. That too was part of what it meant to be alive, if you were one of the
//tiny handful of sentient beings born into the beginning of all things, before
//intelligent life had come fully into its power. That the much vaster future
//depended on what you did here, now, in the earliest days of dawn, when there
//was still so much darkness to be fought, and temporary nuisances like
//Dementors.

// 8341
//Mum and Dad, Hermione’s friendship and Draco’s journey, Neville and Seamus and
//Lavender and Dean, the blue sky and brilliant Sun and all bright things, the
//Earth, the stars, the promise, everything humanity was and everything it would
//become…

// 8342
//On the wand, Harry’s fingers moved into their starting positions; he was ready,
//now, to think the right sort of warm and happy thought.

// 8343
//And Harry’s eyes stared directly at that which lay beneath the tattered cloak,
//looked straight at that which had been named Dementor. The void, the emptiness,
//the hole in the universe, the absence of color and space, the open drain
//through which warmth poured out of the world.

// 8344
//The fear it exuded stole away all happy thoughts, its closeness drained your
//power and strength, its kiss would destroy everything that you were.

// 8345
//__I know you now__, Harry thought as his wand twitched once, twice, thrice
//and four times, as his fingers slid exactly the right distances, __I
//comprehend your nature, you symbolize Death, through some law of magic you are
//a shadow that Death casts into the world.__

// 8346
//__And Death is not something I will ever embrace.__

// 8347
//__It is only a childish thing, that the human species has not yet
//outgrown.__

// 8348
//__And someday…__

// 8349
//__We’ll get over it…__

// 8350
//__And people won’t have to say goodbye any more…__

// 8351
//The wand rose up and leveled straight at the Dementor.

// 8352
//__“EXPECTO PATRONUM!”__

// 8353
//The thought exploded from him like a breaking dam, surged down his arm into his
//wand, burst from it as blazing white light. Light that became corporeal, took
//on shape and substance.

// 8354
//A figure with two arms, two legs, and a head, standing upright; the animal
//__Homo sapiens, __the shape of a human being.

// 8355
//Glowing brighter and brighter as Harry poured all his strength into his spell,
//blazing with incandescent light brighter than the fading sunset, the Aurors and
//Professor Quirrell shielding their eyes in shock -

// 8356
//__And someday when the descendants of humanity have spread from star to
//star, they won’t tell the children about the history of Ancient Earth until
//they’re old enough to bear it; and when they learn they’ll weep to hear that
//such a thing as Death had ever once existed!__

// 8357
//The figure of a human shone more brilliant now than the noonday Sun, so radiant
//that Harry could feel the warmth of it on his skin; and Harry sent out all his
//defiance at the shadow of Death, opening all the floodgates inside him to make
//that bright shape blaze even brighter and yet brighter.

// 8358
//__You are not invincible, and someday the human species will end you.__

// 8359
//__I will end you if I can, by the power of mind and magic and science.__

// 8360
//__I won’t cower in fear of Death, not while I have a chance of winning.__

// 8361
//__I won’t let Death touch me, I won’t let Death touch the ones I love.__

// 8362
//__And even if you do end me before I end you,__

// 8363
//__Another will take my place, and another,__

// 8364
//__Until the wound in the world is healed at last…__

// 8365
//Harry lowered his wand, and the bright figure of a human faded away.

// 8366
//Slowly, he exhaled.

// 8367
//Like waking up from a dream, like opening his eyes after sleep, Harry’s gaze
//moved away from the cage, he looked around and saw that everyone was staring at
//him.

// 8368
//Albus Dumbledore was staring at him.

// 8369
//Professor Quirrell was staring at him.

// 8370
//The Auror trio was staring at him.

// 8371
//They were all looking at him like they’d just seen him destroy a Dementor.

// 8372
//The tattered cloak lay empty within the cage.
