// 118
//__“Of course it was my fault. There’s no one else here who could be
//responsible for anything.”__

// 119
//“Now, just to be clear,” Harry said, “if the professor does levitate you, Dad,
//when you know you haven’t been attached to any wires, that’s going to be
//sufficient evidence. You’re not going to turn around and say that it’s a
//magician’s trick. That wouldn’t be fair play. If you feel that way, you should
//say so __now__, and we can figure out a different experiment instead.”

// 120
//Harry’s father, Professor Michael Verres-Evans, rolled his eyes. “Yes, Harry.”

// 121
//“And you, Mum, your theory says that the professor should be able to do this,
//and if that doesn’t happen, you’ll admit you’re mistaken. Nothing about how
//magic doesn’t work when people are sceptical of it, or anything like that.”

// 122
//Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall was watching Harry with a bemused
//expression. She looked quite witchy in her black robes and pointed hat, but
//when she spoke she sounded formal and Scottish, which didn’t go together with
//the look at all. At first glance she looked like someone who ought to cackle
//and put babies into cauldrons, but the whole effect was ruined as soon as she
//opened her mouth. “Is that sufficient, Mr. Potter?” she said. “Shall I go ahead
//and demonstrate?”

// 123
//“__Sufficient?__ Probably not,” Harry said. “But at least it will
//__help.__ Go ahead, Deputy Headmistress.”

// 124
//“Just Professor will do,” said she, and then, “__Wingardium Leviosa__.”

// 125
//Harry looked at his father.

// 126
//“Huh,” Harry said.

// 127
//His father looked back at him. “Huh,” his father echoed.

// 128
//Then Professor Verres-Evans looked back at Professor McGonagall. “All right,
//you can put me down now.”

// 129
//His father was lowered carefully to the ground.

// 130
//Harry ruffled a hand through his own hair. Maybe it was just that strange part
//of him which had __already__ been convinced, but… “That’s a bit of an
//anticlimax,” Harry said. “You’d think there’d be some kind of more dramatic
//mental event associated with updating on an observation of infinitesimal
//probability -” Harry stopped himself. Mum, the witch, and even his Dad were
//giving him __that look__ again. “I mean, with finding out that everything
//I believe is false.”

// 131
//Seriously, it should have been more dramatic. His brain ought to have been
//flushing its entire current stock of hypotheses about the universe, none of
//which allowed this to happen. But instead his brain just seemed to be going,
//__All right, I saw the Hogwarts Professor wave her wand and make your
//father rise into the air, now what?__

// 132
//The witch-lady was smiling benevolently upon them, looking quite amused. “Would
//you like a further demonstration, Mr. Potter?”

// 133
//“You don’t have to,” Harry said. “We’ve performed a definitive experiment.
//But…” Harry hesitated. He couldn’t help himself. Actually, under the
//circumstances, he __shouldn’t__ be helping himself. It was right and
//proper to be curious. “What else __can__ you do?”

// 134
//Professor McGonagall turned into a cat.

// 135
//Harry scrambled back unthinkingly, backpedalling so fast that he tripped over a
//stray stack of books and landed hard on his bottom with a __thwack.__ His
//hands came down to catch himself without quite reaching properly, and there was
//a warning twinge in his shoulder as the weight came down unbraced.

// 136
//At once the small tabby cat morphed back up into a robed woman. “I’m sorry, Mr.
//Potter,” said the witch, sounding sincere, though the corners of her lips were
//twitching upwards. “I should have warned you.”

// 137
//Harry was breathing in short gasps. His voice came out choked. __“You
//can’t DO that!”__

// 138
//“It’s only a Transfiguration,” said Professor McGonagall. “An Animagus
//transformation, to be exact.”

// 139
//“You turned into a cat! A __SMALL__ cat! You violated Conservation of
//Energy! That’s not just an arbitrary rule, it’s implied by the form of the
//quantum Hamiltonian! Rejecting it destroys unitarity and then you get FTL
//signalling! And cats are __COMPLICATED!__ A human mind can’t just
//visualise a whole cat’s anatomy and, and all the cat biochemistry, and what
//about the __neurology?__ How can you go on __thinking__ using a
//cat-sized brain?”

// 140
//Professor McGonagall’s lips were twitching harder now. “Magic.”

// 141
//“Magic __isn’t enough__ to do that! You’d have to be a god!”

// 142
//Professor McGonagall blinked. “That’s the first time I’ve ever been called
//__that.__”

// 143
//A blur was coming over Harry’s vision, as his brain started to comprehend what
//had just broken. The whole idea of a unified universe with mathematically
//regular laws, that was what had been flushed down the toilet; the whole notion
//of __physics__. Three thousand years of resolving big complicated things
//into smaller pieces, discovering that the music of the planets was the same
//tune as a falling apple, finding that the true laws were perfectly universal
//and had no exceptions anywhere and took the form of simple maths governing the
//smallest parts, __not to mention __that the mind was the brain and the
//brain was made of neurons, a brain was what a person __was__ -

// 144
//And then a woman turned into a cat, so much for all that.

// 145
//A hundred questions fought for priority over Harry’s lips and the winner poured
//out: “And, and what kind of incantation is __Wingardium Leviosa?__ Who
//invents the words to these spells, nursery schoolers?”

// 146
//“That will do, Mr. Potter,” Professor McGonagall said crisply, though her eyes
//shone with suppressed amusement. “If you wish to learn about magic, I suggest
//that we finalise the paperwork so that you can go to Hogwarts.”

// 147
//“Right,” Harry said, somewhat dazed. He pulled his thoughts together. The March
//of Reason would just have to start over, that was all; they still had the
//experimental method and that was the important thing. “How do I get to
//Hogwarts, then?”

// 148
//A choked laugh escaped Professor McGonagall, as if extracted from her by
//tweezers.

// 149
//“Hold on a moment, Harry,” his father said. “Remember why you haven’t been
//going to school up until now? What about your condition?”

// 150
//Professor McGonagall spun to face Michael. “His condition? What’s this?”

// 151
//“I don’t sleep right,” Harry said. He waved his hands helplessly. “My sleep
//cycle is twenty-six hours long, I always go to sleep two hours later, every
//day. I can’t fall asleep any earlier than that, and then the next day I go to
//sleep two hours later than __that.__ 10PM, 12AM, 2AM, 4AM, until it goes
//around the clock. Even if I try to wake up early, it makes no difference and
//I’m a wreck that whole day. That’s why I haven’t been going to a normal school
//up until now.”

// 152
//“One of the reasons,” said his mother. Harry shot her a glare.

// 153
//McGonagall gave a long __hmmmmm.__ “I can’t recall hearing about such a
//condition before…” she said slowly. “I’ll check with Madam Pomfrey to see if
//she knows any remedies.” Then her face brightened. “No, I’m sure this won’t be
//a problem - I’ll find a solution in time. Now,” and her gaze sharpened again,
//“what are these __other__ reasons?”

// 154
//Harry sent his parents a glare. “I am a conscientious objector to child
//conscription, on grounds that I should not have to suffer for a disintegrating
//school system’s failure to provide teachers or study materials of even
//minimally adequate quality.”

// 155
//Both of Harry’s parents howled with laughter at that, like they thought it was
//all a big joke. “Oh,” said Harry’s father, eyes bright, “is __that__ why
//you bit a maths teacher in third year.”

// 156
//“__She didn’t know what a logarithm was!__”

// 157
//“Of course,” seconded Harry’s mother. “Biting her was a very mature response to
//that.”

// 158
//Harry’s father nodded. “A well-considered policy for addressing the problem of
//teachers who don’t understand logarithms.”

// 159
//“I was __seven years old!__ How long are you going to keep on bringing
//that up?”

// 160
//“I know,” said his mother sympathetically, “you bite __one __maths teacher
//and they never let you forget it, do they?”

// 161
//Harry turned to Professor McGonagall. “There! You see what I have to deal
//with?”

// 162
//“Excuse me,” said Petunia, and fled through the backdoor into the garden, from
//which her screams of laughter were clearly audible.

// 163
//“There, ah, there,” Professor McGonagall seemed to be having trouble speaking
//for some reason, “there is to be no biting of teachers at Hogwarts, is that
//quite clear, Mr. Potter?”

// 164
//Harry scowled at her. “Fine, I won’t bite anyone who doesn’t bite me first.”

// 165
//Professor Michael Verres-Evans also had to leave the room briefly upon hearing
//that.

// 166
//“Well,” Professor McGonagall sighed, after Harry’s parents had composed
//themselves and returned. “Well. I think, under the circumstances, that I should
//avoid taking you to purchase your study materials until a day or two before
//school begins.”

// 167
//“What? Why? The other children already know magic, don’t they? I have to start
//catching up right away!”

// 168
//“Rest assured, Mr. Potter,” replied Professor McGonagall, “Hogwarts is quite
//capable of teaching the basics. And I suspect, Mr. Potter, that if I leave you
//alone for two months with your schoolbooks, even without a wand, I will return
//to this house only to find a crater billowing purple smoke, a depopulated city
//surrounding it and a plague of flaming zebras terrorising what remains of
//England.”

// 169
//Harry’s mother and father nodded in perfect unison.

// 170
//“__Mum! Dad!__”
