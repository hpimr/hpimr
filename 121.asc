//== Something to Protect: Severus Snape

// 19892
//A somber mood pervaded the Headmistress’s office. Minerva had returned after
//dropping off Draco and Narcissa/Nancy at St. Mungo’s, where the Lady Malfoy was
//being examined to see if a decade living as a Muggle had done any damage to her
//health; and Harry had come up to the Headmistress’s office again and then… not
//been able to think of priorities. There was so __much__ to do, so many
//things, that even Headmistress McGonagall didn’t seem to know where to start,
//and certainly not Harry. Right now Minerva was repeatedly writing words on
//parchment and then erasing them with a handwave, and Harry had closed his eyes
//for clarity. Was there any __next__ first thing that needed to happen…

// 19893
//There came a knock upon the great oaken door that had been Dumbledore’s, and
//the Headmistress opened it with a word.

// 19894
//The man who entered the Headmistress’s office appeared worn, he had discarded
//his wheelchair but still walked with a limp. He wore black robes that were
//simple, yet clean and unstained. Over his left shoulder was slung a knapsack,
//of sturdy gray leather set with silver filigree that held four green pearl-like
//stones. It looked like a thoroughly enchanted knapsack, one that could contain
//the contents of a Muggle house.

// 19895
//One look at him, and Harry knew.

// 19896
//Headmistress McGonagall sat frozen behind her new desk.

// 19897
//Severus Snape inclined his head to her.

// 19898
//“What is the meaning of this?” said the Headmistress, sounding… heart-sick,
//like she’d known, upon a glance, just like Harry had.

// 19899
//“I resign my position as the Potions Master of Hogwarts,” the man said simply.
//“I will not stay to draw my last month’s salary. If there are students who have
//been particularly harmed by me, you may use the money for their benefit.”

// 19900
//__He knows.__ The thought came to Harry, and he couldn’t have said in
//words just __what__ the Potions Master now knew; except that it was clear
//that Severus knew it.

// 19901
//“Severus…” Headmistress McGonagall began. Her voice sounded hollow. “Professor
//Severus Snape, you may not realize how difficult it is to find Potions Masters
//who can safely teach Muggleborns, or Professors sharp enough to keep Slytherin
//House in any semblance of order…”

// 19902
//Again the man inclined his head. “I think it need not be said to you,
//Headmistress, but I recommend in the strongest possible terms that the next
//Head of Slytherin be nothing like me.”

// 19903
//“Severus, you only did as Albus told you to do! You could stay on and act
//differently!”

// 19904
//“Headmistress,” Harry said. His own voice seemed also hollow, and Harry
//wondered at it, for he hadn’t known Severus Snape that well. “If he wants to
//go, I think you should let him go.”

// 19905
//__Dumbledore was using him. Maybe not exactly the way Professor Quirrell
//thought, maybe it was prophecy rather than sabotaging Slytherin, but Dumbledore
//was still using him. There were things that could have been said long ago to
//Severus, to free him. It’s clear why Dumbledore didn’t risk that, but still,
//Severus wasn’t being used kindly. Even his blindness and grief were being used,
//the way he didn’t grasp the consequences of his actions as Potions Master…__

// 19906
//“It is well to find you here, Mr. Potter,” Severus said. “There is unfinished
//business between us.”

// 19907
//Harry didn’t know what to say, so he just nodded.

// 19908
//Severus seemed to be having some difficulty speaking, as he stood before the
//two of them with the grey knapsack on his shoulder. Finally he seemed to find
//the words he’d come to speak. “Your mother. Lily. She was -”

// 19909
//“I know,” Harry said, through the thickness of his throat. “You don’t have to
//say it.”

// 19910
//“Lily was a fine upstanding witch, Mr. Potter. I would not have you think
//otherwise from any words I said to you.”

// 19911
//“__Severus?__” said Minerva McGonagall, looking as shocked as if she’d
//been bitten by her own shoes.

// 19912
//The former Potions Master kept his eyes on Harry. “More than one bar lay
//between myself and Lily, most notably my ill-advised attempts to curry favor
//with the purebloods of my house. If I made it sound like one mistake upon a
//muddy field ended it all, if I pretended that she had no reason but shallowness
//not to love me, I hope your books have also told you why fools may say such
//things.”

// 19913
//“They did,” Harry said. He was looking at the fine gray knapsack on Severus
//Snape’s left shoulder, unable to meet the Potions Master’s eyes. “They did.”

// 19914
//“However,” the former Potions Master continued, “I’m afraid I have nothing more
//to say about your father than what I’ve already told you.”

// 19915
//__“Severus!”__

// 19916
//The former Potions Master seemed to have eyes only for Harry. “The Dark Mark
//upon my arm is not dead, nor is the prophecy fulfilled by that story you
//recounted before the crowd. How did you destroy all but a remnant of the Dark
//Lord?”

// 19917
//Harry hesitated. “I Obliviated most of his memories and… sealed him, I guess is
//how wizards say it. Even if the seal breaks, he won’t come back as himself.”

// 19918
//Severus frowned briefly and then shrugged. “I suppose that is acceptable.”

// 19919
//“Professor Snape,” Harry said, because this too was now his responsibility,
//“the Order of the Phoenix owes you for services rendered. I’m in an excellent
//position to repay it, both financially and magically. Just in case you want to
//start your next life in a position of wealth, or with better hair, or
//something.”

// 19920
//“Strange words to say to such as me,” the former Potions Master said in a soft
//drawl. “I went to the Dark Lord intending to sell him the prophecy in exchange
//for Lily’s love becoming mine, by whatever darkness was required to achieve it.
//That is hardly something to be forgiven lightly. And then, in the years after
//when I was a Potions Master… that you experienced yourself. Do you think my
//service to the Order of the Phoenix has repaid all my sins?”

// 19921
//“People are always broken,” Harry said, though the words stuck in his throat.
//“They always make mistakes. At least you tried to repay them.”

// 19922
//“Perhaps,” said the former Potions Master. “My final duty was to fail in
//guarding the Stone, to be struck down. This I have done, and I survived it,
//which I never expected to do.” Severus was leaning against the door through
//which he’d entered, taking his weight off his left leg. “I would not have
//thought to ask for your forgiveness, but since you offer it so freely, I will
//accept with thanks. From this day on I wish to take less unkindly ways, and I
//think that is best done by starting over.”

// 19923
//Tears glistened on Minerva McGonagall’s nose and cheeks, when she spoke her
//voice was without hope. “Surely you could start over inside Hogwarts.”

// 19924
//Severus shook his head. “Too many students would remember me as the evil
//Potions Master. No, Minerva. I will go someplace new, and take a new name, and
//find someone new to love.”

// 19925
//“Severus Snape,” Harry said, because it was his responsibility to say it, “has
//all your will been done?”

// 19926
//“Lily’s killer is vanquished,” the man said. “I am content.”

// 19927
//The Headmistress lowered her head. “Be well, Severus,” she whispered.

// 19928
//“I do have one last piece of advice,” Harry said. “If you want it.”

// 19929
//“What is it?” said Severus Snape.

// 19930
//“Ruminating about the past can contribute to depression. You have my blanket
//permisson to just never think about your past, ever. You shouldn’t think that
//it’s your responsibility to Lily to bear your guilt for her, or anything like
//that. Just keep your mind on your future and whatever new people you meet.”

// 19931
//“I shall take your wisdom into consideration,” Severus said neutrally.

// 19932
//“Also, try a different brand of hair shampoo.”

// 19933
//A wry grin crossed Severus’s face, and Harry thought it might have been, for
//the first time, that man’s true smile. “Drop dead, Potter.”

// 19934
//Harry laughed.

// 19935
//Severus laughed.

// 19936
//Minerva was sobbing.

// 19937
//Without saying anything else, the free man took a pinch of Floo powder, and
//cast it into the office’s fireplace, and strode into the green flame whispering
//something that nobody caught; and that was the last that anyone ever heard of
//Severus Snape.
