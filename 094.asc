//== Roles, Pt 5

// 16694
//__The first meeting:__

// 16695
//At 6:07am on April 17th, 1992 the Sun was just rising above the horizon as seen
//from the castle Hogwarts, filtering in through drawn curtains in the Ravenclaw
//first-year boys’ dorm to provide a gentle light, red-orange for dawn and
//little-changed by the white fabric covering the windows, not yet waking boys
//more accustomed to winter’s schedule.

// 16696
//In one bed among many, Harry Potter slept the sleep of the just exhausted.

// 16697
//Quietly the door opened.

// 16698
//Quietly a figure walked across the floor.

// 16699
//That figure came to Harry Potter’s bed.

// 16700
//The figure laid a hand on the shoulder of the sleeping boy, who started and
//shrieked.

// 16701
//No others heard.

// 16702
//“Mr. Potter,” the small man squeaked, “the Headmaster has requested your
//presence immediately.”

// 16703
//Slowly the boy sat up in bed, his hands momentarily fiddling beneath the
//covers. He’d expected to feel much worse, waking up this morning. It felt…
//wrong, that his brain functioned now, that his thoughts still moved, that he
//wasn’t incapacitated with weeping for at least a week. The boy knew that it
//wouldn’t have been an adaptive response, for brains to evolve to do that. His
//dark side, certainly, would not do that. Even so, it still felt wrong to be
//alive and lucid, this morning.

// 16704
//But his resolution to revive Hermione Granger felt - sufficient, like he was
//already doing the right thing, bent on the right path, and she would be brought
//back, and that was all there was to it; grief would have been giving up. There
//was nothing left to decide, no ambiguity, no conflict to tear at him, and no
//need to remember what he’d __seen__ -

// 16705
//“I’ll get dressed,” Harry said.

// 16706
//Professor Flitwick looked rather reluctant, but said in his high voice, “The
//Headmaster specified you were to be brought to his office directly and without
//pause, Mr. Potter. I’m sorry.”

// 16707
//Less than a minute later - Professor Flitwick had sent him straight to the
//Headmaster’s office through the Hogwarts internal Floo - Harry found himself,
//still in his pajamas, facing Albus Dumbledore. The Deputy Headmistress was also
//sitting in another chair, and the Potions Master lurked nearby amid the weird
//devices, caught in a gaping yawn just as Harry had entered through the
//fireplace.

// 16708
//“Harry,” the Headmaster said without preamble, “before I say what I must say
//next, I tell you that Hermione Granger did truly die. The wards recorded it and
//informed me. The very stones spoke that a witch had died. I tested her body
//where it lay and those were Hermione Granger’s true mortal remains, not any
//doll or likeness. There is no way known to wizardry by which death may be
//undone. All this being said, Hermione Granger’s remains are now missing from
//the storeroom where they were placed, and where you guarded them. Did you take
//them, Harry Potter?”

// 16709
//“No,” Harry said, narrowing his eyes. A glance showed him that Severus was
//watching him intently.

// 16710
//Dumbledore’s gaze was also keen, though not unfriendly. “Is Hermione Granger’s
//body in your possession?”

// 16711
//“No.”

// 16712
//“Do you know where it is?”

// 16713
//“No.”

// 16714
//“Do you know who took it?”

// 16715
//“No,” Harry said, then hesitated. “Besides the obvious probabilistic
//speculations which are not based upon any specific knowledge of mine.”

// 16716
//The old wizard nodded. “Do you know why it was taken?”

// 16717
//“No. Besides the obvious speculations etcetera.”

// 16718
//“What would those be?” Sharp the ancient eyes.

// 16719
//“If the enemy can notice you running off to consult the Weasley twins during
//class after Hermione was arrested, and find out about that magic map you said
//was stolen, then the enemy can wonder why I was guarding Hermione Granger’s
//body. My turn. Did you arrange for Hermione’s death in hopes of getting the
//money back from Lucius?”

// 16720
//“__What?__” said Professor McGonagall.

// 16721
//“No,” said the old wizard.

// 16722
//“Did you know or suspect that Hermione Granger would die?”

// 16723
//“I did not know. As for suspicions, I placed her in the most strongly defended
//position I could, against Voldemort. I did not will her death, nor allow it,
//nor plan to benefit from it, Harry Potter. Now show me your pouch.”

// 16724
//“It’s in my trunk -” Harry began.

// 16725
//“Severus,” said the old wizard, and the Potions Master moved forward. “Check
//his trunk as well, every compartment.”

// 16726
//“My trunk has wards.”

// 16727
//Severus Snape grinned mirthlessly and strode into the green flame.

// 16728
//Dumbledore took out his long dark-grey wand and began to wave it close around
//Harry’s hair, looking like a Muggle using a metal-detector. Before he had
//reached as far as Harry’s neck, Dumbledore stopped.

// 16729
//“The gem upon your ring,” Dumbledore said. “It is no longer a clear diamond. It
//is brown, the color of Hermione Granger’s eyes, and the color of her hair.”

// 16730
//A sudden tension filled the room.

// 16731
//“That’s my father’s rock,” Harry said. “Transfigured the same as before. I just
//did it to remember Hermione -”

// 16732
//“I must be sure. Take off that ring, Harry, and place it upon my desk.”

// 16733
//Slowly, Harry did so, removing the gem and setting the ring off to the other
//side of the desk.

// 16734
//Dumbledore pointed his wand at the gem and -

// 16735
//A large, undistinguished grey rock jumped into the air from the force of its
//sudden expansion, hit some invisible barrier in the air above, and then fell
//with a loud crack upon the Headmaster’s desk,

// 16736
//“There’s another half-hour of work for me, Transfiguring it again,” Harry said
//evenly.

// 16737
//Dumbledore resumed his examination. Harry had to remove his left shoe, and take
//off the toe-ring that was his emergency portkey if someone kidnapped him and
//took him outside the wards of Hogwarts (and didn’t put up anti-Apparition,
//anti-portkey, anti-phoenix, and anti-time-looping wards, which Severus had
//warned Harry that any inner-circle Death Eater would certainly do). It was
//verified that the magic radiating from the toe-ring was indeed the magic of a
//portkey, and not the magic of a Transfiguration. The rest of Harry was deemed
//clear.

// 16738
//Not long after, the Potions Master returned, bearing Harry’s pouch, and several
//other magical things which had been in Harry’s trunk, which the Headmaster also
//examined, one by one, even to all the items remaining within the healer’s kit.

// 16739
//“Can I go now?” Harry said when it was all done, putting as much cold as he
//could into his voice. He took up his pouch, and began the process of feeding
//the grey rock into it. The empty ring went back on his finger.

// 16740
//The old wizard breathed out, slipping his wand back into his sleeve. “I
//__am__ sorry,” he said. “I had to know. Harry… the Dark Lord has taken
//Hermione Granger’s remains, it seems. I cannot think of anything he would gain
//thereby, except to send her corpse against you as an Inferius. Severus shall
//give you certain potions to keep about your person. Be warned now, and be
//prepared for when you must do what must be done.”

// 16741
//“Will the Inferius have Hermione’s mind?”

// 16742
//“No -”

// 16743
//“Then it’s not her. Can I go? At least to change out of my pyjamas.”

// 16744
//“There is other news, but I shall be brief. The wards of Hogwarts record that
//no foreign creature has entered, and that it was the Defense Professor who
//killed Hermione Granger.”

// 16745
//“Um,” Harry said.

// 16746
//__Thought 1: But I saw the troll kill Hermione.__

// 16747
//__Thought 2: Professor Quirrell Memory-Charmed me and set up the scene
//that Dumbledore saw when he arrived.__

// 16748
//__Thought 3: Professor Quirrell can’t do that, his magic can’t touch
//mine. I saw that in Azkaban -__

// 16749
//__Thought 4: Can I trust those memories?__

// 16750
//__Thought 5: There was clearly some sort of debacle at Azkaban, we
//wouldn’t have needed a rocket if Professor Quirrell hadn’t fallen unconscious,
//and why’d he be unconscious if not -__

// 16751
//__Thought 6: Did I ever actually go to Azkaban at all?__

// 16752
//__Thought 7: I clearly practiced controlling Dementors at some point
//before I scared that Dementor in the Wizengamot. And __that__ was in the
//newspapers.__

// 16753
//__Thought 8: Am I accurately remembering the newspapers?__

// 16754
//“Um,” Harry said again. “That spell seriously ought to be Unforgiveable. You
//think Professor Quirrell could have Memory-Charmed -”

// 16755
//“No. I went back through time and placed certain instruments to record
//Hermione’s last battle, which I could not quite bear to watch in my own
//person.” The old wizard looked very grim indeed. “Your guess was right, Harry
//Potter. Voldemort sabotaged everything we gave Hermione to protect her. Her
//broomstick lay dead in her hands. Her invisibility cloak did not conceal her.
//The troll walked in the sunlight unharmed; it was no stray creature, but a
//weapon pure and aimed. And it was indeed the troll who killed her, with
//strength alone, so that my wards and webs to detect hostile magics went for
//naught. The Defense Professor never crossed her path.”

// 16756
//Harry swallowed, shut his eyes, and thought. “So this was an attempted frame on
//Professor Quirrell. Somehow. It does seem to be the enemy’s __modus
//operandi.__ Troll eats Hermione Granger, check the wards, oh look actually the
//Defense Professor did it, same as last year… no. No, that can’t be right.”

// 16757
//“Why not, Mr. Potter?” said the Potions Master. “It seems obvious enough to me
//-”

// 16758
//“That’s the problem.”

// 16759
//__The enemy is smart.__

// 16760
//Slowly the fog of sleep was drifting out of Harry’s mind, and after a full
//night’s sleep his brain could see the things which hadn’t been obvious the day
//before.

// 16761
//Under standard literary convention… the enemy wasn’t supposed to look over what
//you’d done, sabotage the magic items you’d handed out, and then send out a
//troll rendered undetectable by some means the heroes couldn’t figure out even
//after the fact, so that you might as well have not defended yourself at all. In
//a book, the point-of-view usually stayed on the main characters. Having the
//enemy just bypass all the protagonists’ work, as a result of planning and
//actions taken out of literary sight, would be a __diabolus ex machina,__
//and dramatically unsatisfying.

// 16762
//But in real life the enemy would think that they were the main character, and
//they would also be clever, and think things through in advance, even if you
//didn’t see them do it. That was why everything about this felt so disjointed,
//with parts unexplained and seemingly inexplicable. How had Lucius felt, when
//Harry had threatened Dumbledore with breaking Azkaban? How had the Aurors above
//Azkaban felt, seeing the broomstick rise up on a torch of fire?

// 16763
//__The enemy is smart.__

// 16764
//“The enemy knew perfectly well that you’d turn back time to check what really
//happened to Hermione, especially since the troll getting into Hogwarts at all
//tells us that somebody can fool the wards.” Harry shut his eyes, thinking
//harder, trying to put himself into the enemy’s shoes. Why would he, or his dark
//side, have done something like - “We’re meant to conclude that the enemy has
//control of what the wards tell us. But that’s actually something the enemy can
//only do with difficulty, or under special conditions; they’re trying to create
//a false appearance of omnipotence.” __Like I would.__ “Later,
//hypothetically, the wards show Professor Sinistra killing someone. We think the
//wards are just being fooled again, but really, Professor Sinistra was
//Legilimized and she __did__ do it.”

// 16765
//“Unless that is precisely what the Dark Lord expects us to think,” said Severus
//Snape, his brow furrowed in concentration. “In which case he does have control
//of the wards, and Professor Sinistra will be innocent.”

// 16766
//“Does the Dark Lord __really__ use plots with that many levels of meta -”

// 16767
//“Yes,” said Dumbledore and Severus.

// 16768
//Harry nodded distantly. “Then this could be a setup to either make us think the
//wards are telling the truth when they’re lying, or a setup to make us think the
//wards are lying when they’re telling the truth, depending on what level the
//enemy expects us to reason at. But if the enemy is planning to make us trust
//the wards - we would have trusted the wards anyway, if we’d been given no
//reason to distrust them. So there’s no need to go to all the work of framing
//Professor Quirrell in a way that we would realize we were intended to discover,
//just to trick us into going meta -”

// 16769
//“Not so,” said Dumbledore. “If Voldemort has not fully mastered the wards, then
//the wards had to believe that some Professor’s hand was at work. Else they
//would have cried out at Miss Granger’s injury, and not only upon her death.”

// 16770
//Harry reached up a hand and rubbed at his brow, just beneath his hair.

// 16771
//__Okay, serious question. If the enemy is that smart, why the heck am I
//still alive? Is it seriously that hard to poison someone, are there Charms and
//Potions and bezoars which can cure me of literally anything that could be
//slipped into my breakfast? ____Would the wards record it, trace the magic
//of the murderer?__

// 16772
//__Could my __scar__ contain the fragment of soul that’s keeping the
//Dark Lord anchored to the world, so he doesn’t want to kill me? Instead he’s
//trying to drive off all my friends to weaken my spirit so he can take over my
//body? It’d explain the Parselmouth thing. The Sorting Hat might not be able to
//detect a lich-phylactery-thingy. Obvious problem 1, the Dark Lord is supposed
//to have made his lich-phylactery-thingy in 1943 by killing whatshername and
//framing Mr. Hagrid. Obvious problem 2, there’s no such thing as souls.__

// 16773
//__Though Dumbledore also thought that my blood was a key ingredient in a
//ritual to restore the Dark Lord’s full strength, which would require keeping me
//alive until then… now there’s a cheery thought.__

// 16774
//“Well…” Harry said. “I’m sure of one thing.”

// 16775
//“And that is?”

// 16776
//“Neville needs to be taken out of Hogwarts __now. __He’s the obvious next
//target and no first-year student can survive this level of offense. We’re lucky
//Neville wasn’t assassinated yesterday evening, the enemy doesn’t have to wait
//until we’re finished mourning to make their next move.” __Why didn’t the
//enemy strike while we were distracted?__

// 16777
//Dumbledore exchanged glances with Severus, and then with the suddenly tight
//expression of Professor McGonagall. “Harry,” said the old wizard, “if you send
//all your friends away yourself, that is just the same as if Voldemort -”

// 16778
//“I will be __fine__ I can do without Neville for a couple of extra months
//it’s not like you were planning to make my friends stay here over the summer
//and that is just plain __not sufficient justification__ to let him get
//killed! Professor McGonagall -”

// 16779
//“I quite agree,” said the Scottish witch. She frowned. “I extremely agree. I
//agree to the point where… I’m having some trouble figuring out how to express
//this, Albus…”

// 16780
//“To the point where you’re going to haul him out of there yourself, regardless
//of what anyone else says, because it’s no excuse to say you were only following
//orders if Neville gets killed?” Harry said.

// 16781
//Professor McGonagall closed her eyes briefly. “Yes, but surely there ought to
//be some way to be responsible without threats of unilateral action.”

// 16782
//The Headmaster sighed. “No need. Go, Minerva.”

// 16783
//“Wait,” the Potions Master said, just as Professor McGonagall, moving rather
//swiftly, was taking a pinch of green dust from the Floo-vase. “We should not
//call attention to the boy, as the Headmaster called attention to the Weasley
//twins. It would be wiser, I think, if Mr. Longbottom’s grandmother took him
//from Hogwarts. Let him stay in his Common Room for now; the Dark Lord does not
//seem able to act so openly.”

// 16784
//There was another long exchange of glances among the four, and finally Harry
//nodded, followed by Professor McGonagall.

// 16785
//“In that case,” said Harry, “I’m sure of one other thing.”

// 16786
//“And that is?” said Dumbledore.

// 16787
//“I very much need to visit the washroom, and I would also like to change out of
//these pyjamas.”

// 16788
//“By the way,” Harry said as he and the Headmaster emerged from Floo into the
//empty office of the Ravenclaw Head of House. “One last quick question I wanted
//to ask just you. That sword the Weasley twins pulled out of the Sorting Hat.
//That was the Sword of Gryffindor, wasn’t it?”

// 16789
//The old wizard turned, face neutral. “What makes you think that, Harry?”

// 16790
//“The Sorting Hat yelled__ Gryffindor!__ just before handing it out, the
//sword had a ruby pommel and gold letters on the blade, and the Latin script
//said __Nothing better__. Just a hunch.”

// 16791
//“__Nihil supernum,__” said the old wizard. “That is not __quite__
//what it means.”

// 16792
//Harry nodded. “Mmhm. What’d you do with it?”

// 16793
//“I retrieved it from where it fell, and placed it in a secure place,” the old
//wizard said. He gave Harry a stern look. “I hope you are not greedy for it
//yourself, young Ravenclaw.”

// 16794
//“Not at all, just want to make sure you’re not keeping it permanently from its
//rightful wielders. So the Weasley twins are the Heir of Gryffindor, then?”

// 16795
//“The Heir of Gryffindor?” Dumbledore said, looking surprised. Then the old
//wizard smiled, blue eyes twinkling brightly. “Ah, Harry, Salazar Slytherin may
//have built a Chamber of Secrets into Hogwarts, but Godric Gryffindor was not
//much given to such extravagances. We have seen only that Godric left his Sword
//to the defense of Hogwarts, if a worthy student ever faced a foe they could not
//defeat alone.”

// 16796
//“That’s not the same as saying no. Don’t think I didn’t notice that you didn’t
//actually say no.”

// 16797
//“I did not live in those years, Harry, and I do not know all that Godric
//Gryffindor may or may not have done -”

// 16798
//“Do you in fact assign greater than fifty percent subjective probability that
//there is something like a Heir of Gryffindor and one or both Weasley twins are
//it. Yes or no, evasion means yes. You’re not going to succeed in distracting
//me, no matter how much I have to go to the bathroom.”

// 16799
//The old wizard sighed. “Yes, Fred and George Weasley are the Heir of
//Gryffindor. I beg you not to speak of it to them, not yet.”

// 16800
//Harry nodded, and turned to go. “I’m surprised,” Harry said. “I read a little
//about Godric Gryffindor’s historical life. The Weasley twins are… well, they’re
//awesome in various ways, but they don’t seem much like the Godric in the
//history books.”

// 16801
//“Only a man exceedingly proud and vain,” Dumbledore said quietly, as he turned
//back to the Floo roaring up again with green flames, “would believe that his
//heir should be like himself, rather than like who he wished that he could be.”

// 16802
//The Headmaster stepped into green fire, and was gone.

// 16803
//__The second meeting (in a small cubby off the Hufflepuff Common Room):__

// 16804
//Neville Longbottom’s face was drawn up in anguish, as he spoke with no one to
//hear, to the empty air.

// 16805
//“Seriously,” the empty air said back to him. “I’m wearing an invisibility cloak
//with extra anti-detection charms just to walk through the hallways because
//__I__ don’t want to be killed. My parents would have me out of Hogwarts in
//an instant if the Headmaster allowed it. Neville, your getting the heck out of
//Hogwarts is common sense, it has __nothing to do__ with -”

// 16806
//“I betrayed you, General,” Neville said, his voice around as hollow as any
//normal eleven-year-old boy could reasonably manage. “I didn’t even do it the
//Chaotic way. I conformed to authority and tried to make you conform to
//authority too. What’s that you always say, about how in the Chaos Legion, a
//soldier who can only obey orders is useless?”

// 16807
//“Neville,” the empty air said firmly. The pressure of two hands, beneath thin
//cloth, came firmly to bear on Neville’s shoulders; and the voice moved closer
//to him. “You weren’t blindly obeying authority, you were trying to protect me.
//It’s true that in this chaotic world, soldiers who can only follow rules and
//regulations are worthless. However, soldiers who follow rules for the sake of
//protecting their friends are -”

// 16808
//“Slightly better than worthless?” Neville said bitterly.

// 16809
//“__Significantly__ better than worthless. Neville, you made an error of
//judgment. It cost me around six seconds. Now it could be that Hermione’s
//injuries were just barely fatal, but even then, I don’t think six seconds was
//actually enough time for the troll to take an extra bite of Hermione. In the
//counterfactual world where you didn’t step in front of me, Hermione still died.
//Now, I could stand here listing out the first dozen ways that Hermione would be
//alive if I hadn’t been stupid -”

// 16810
//“You? __You__ ran right out after her. __I’m__ the one who tried to
//stop you. It’s my fault if it’s anyone’s,” Neville said bitterly.

// 16811
//The empty air went silent at this for a while.

// 16812
//“Wow,” the empty air finally said. “Wow. That puts a pretty different
//perspective on things, I have to say. I’m going to remember this the next time
//I feel an impulse to blame myself for something. Neville, the term in the
//literature for this is ‘egocentric bias’, it means that you experience
//everything about your own life but you don’t get to experience everything else
//that happens in the world. There was way, way more going on than you running in
//front of me. You’re going to spend weeks remembering that thing you did there
//for six seconds, I can tell, but nobody else is going to bother thinking about
//it. Other people spend a lot less time thinking about your past mistakes than
//you do, just because you’re not the center of their worlds. I
//__guarantee__ to you that nobody except you has even __considered__
//blaming Neville Longbottom for what happened to Hermione. Not for a fraction of
//a second. You are being, if you will pardon the phrase, a silly-dilly. Now shut
//up and say goodbye.”

// 16813
//“I don’t want to say goodbye,” Neville said. His voice was trembling, but he
//managed not to cry. “I want to stay here and fight with you against - against
//whatever’s happening.”

// 16814
//The empty air moved closer to him, and embraced him in a hug, and Harry
//Potter’s voice whispered, “Tough luck.”
