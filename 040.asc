//== Pretending to be Wise, Pt 2

// 7649
//Harry, holding the tea cup in the exactly correct way that Professor Quirrell
//had needed to demonstrate three times, took a small, careful sip. All the way
//across the long, wide table that was the centerpiece of Mary’s Room, Professor
//Quirrell took a sip from his own cup, making it look far more natural and
//elegant. The tea itself was something whose name Harry couldn’t even pronounce,
//or at least, every time Harry had tried to repeat the Chinese words, Professor
//Quirrell had corrected him, until finally Harry had given up.

// 7650
//Harry had maneuvered himself into getting a glimpse at the bill last time, and
//Professor Quirrell had let him get away with it.

// 7651
//He’d felt an impulse to drink a Comed-Tea first.

// 7652
//__Even taking that into account__, Harry had still been shocked out of his
//skin.

// 7653
//And it still tasted to him like, well, tea.

// 7654
//There was a quiet, nagging suspicion in Harry’s mind that Professor Quirrell
//__knew__ this, and was deliberately buying ridiculously expensive tea that
//Harry couldn’t appreciate __just to mess with him.__ Professor Quirrell
//__himself__ might not like it all that much. Maybe __nobody__
//actually liked this tea, and the only point of it was to be ridiculously
//expensive and make the victim feel unappreciative. In fact, maybe it was really
//just ordinary tea, only you asked for it in a certain code, and they put a fake
//gigantic price on the bill…

// 7655
//Professor Quirrell’s expression was drawn and thoughtful. “No,” Professor
//Quirrell said, “you should __not__ have told the Headmaster about your
//conversation with Lord Malfoy. Please try to think faster next time, Mr.
//Potter.”

// 7656
//“I’m sorry, Professor Quirrell,” Harry said meekly. “I still don’t see it.”
//There were times when Harry felt very much like an impostor, pretending to be
//cunning in Professor Quirrell’s presence.

// 7657
//“Lord Malfoy is Albus Dumbledore’s opponent,” said Professor Quirrell. “At
//least for this present time. All Britain is their chessboard, all wizards their
//pieces. Consider: Lord Malfoy threatened to throw away everything, abandon his
//game, to take vengeance on you if Mr. Malfoy was hurt. In which case, Mr.
//Potter…?”

// 7658
//It took more long seconds for Harry to get it, but it was clear that Professor
//Quirrell wasn’t going to give any more hints, not that Harry wanted them.

// 7659
//Then Harry’s mind finally made the connection, and he frowned. “Dumbledore
//kills Draco, makes it look like __I__ did it, and Lucius sacrifices his
//game against Dumbledore to get at me? That… doesn’t seem like the Headmaster’s
//__style,__ Professor Quirrell…” Harry’s mind flashed back to a similar
//warning from Draco, which had made Harry say the same thing.

// 7660
//Professor Quirrell shrugged, and sipped his tea.

// 7661
//Harry sipped his own tea, and sat in silence. The tablecloth spread over the
//table was in a very peaceful pattern, seeming at first like plain cloth, but if
//you stared at it long enough, or kept silent long enough, you started to see a
//faint tracery of flowers glimmering on it; the curtains of the room had changed
//their pattern to match, and seemed to shimmer as though in a silent breeze.
//Professor Quirrell was in a contemplative mood that Saturday, and so was Harry,
//and Mary’s Room, it seemed, had not neglected to notice this.

// 7662
//“Professor Quirrell,” Harry said suddenly, “is there an afterlife?”

// 7663
//Harry had chosen the question carefully. Not, __do you believe in an
//afterlife?__ but simply __Is there an afterlife?__ What people
//__really__ believed didn’t seem to them like __beliefs__ at all.
//People didn’t say, ‘I strongly believe in the sky being blue!’ They just said,
//‘the sky is blue’. Your true inner map of the world just felt to you like the
//way the world __was…__

// 7664
//The Defense Professor raised his cup to his lips again before answering. His
//face was thoughtful. “If there is, Mr. Potter,” said Professor Quirrell, “then
//quite a few wizards have wasted a great deal of effort in their searches for
//immortality.”

// 7665
//“That’s not actually an answer,” Harry observed. He’d learned by now to notice
//that sort of thing when talking to Professor Quirrell.

// 7666
//Professor Quirrell set down his teacup with a small, high-pitched tacking sound
//on his saucer. “Some of those wizards were reasonably intelligent, Mr. Potter,
//so you may take it that the existence of an afterlife is not obvious. I have
//looked into the matter myself. There have been many claims of the sort which
//hope and fear would be expected to produce. Among those reports whose veracity
//is not in doubt, there is nothing which could not be the result of mere
//wizardry. There are certain devices said to communicate with the dead, but
//these, I suspect, only project an image from the mind; the result seems
//indistinguishable from memory because it __is__ memory. The alleged
//spirits tell no secrets they knew in life, nor could have learned after death,
//which are not known to the wielder -”

// 7667
//“Which is why the Resurrection Stone is not the most valuable magical artifact
//in the world,” said Harry.

// 7668
//“Precisely,” said Professor Quirrell, “though I wouldn’t say no to a chance to
//try it.” There was a dry, thin smile on his lips; and something colder, more
//distant, in his eyes. “You spoke to Dumbledore of that as well, I take it.”

// 7669
//Harry nodded.

// 7670
//The curtains were taking on a faintly blue pattern, and a dim tracery of
//elaborate snowflakes now seemed to be becoming visible on the tablecloth.
//Professor Quirrell’s voice sounded very calm. “The Headmaster can be very
//persuasive, Mr. Potter. I hope he has not persuaded you.”

// 7671
//“__Heck__ no,” said Harry. “Didn’t fool me for a second.”

// 7672
//“I should hope not,” said Professor Quirrell, still in that very calm tone. “I
//would be extremely put out to discover that the Headmaster had convinced you to
//throw away your life on some fool plot by telling you that death is the next
//great adventure.”

// 7673
//“I don’t think the Headmaster believed it himself, actually,” Harry said. He
//sipped his own tea again. “He asked me what I could possibly do with eternity,
//gave me the usual line about it being boring, and he didn’t seem to see any
//conflict between that and his own claim to have an immortal soul. In fact, he
//gave me a whole long lecture about how awful it was to want immortality before
//he claimed to have an immortal soul. I can’t quite visualize what must have
//been going on inside his head, but I don’t think he __actually__ had a
//mental model of himself continuing forever in the afterlife…”

// 7674
//The temperature of the room seemed to be dropping.

// 7675
//“You perceive,” said a voice like ice from the other end of the table, “that
//Dumbledore does not truly believe as he speaks. It is not that he has
//compromised his principles. It is that he never had them from the beginning.
//Are you becoming cynical yet, Mr. Potter?”

// 7676
//Harry had dropped his eyes to his teacup. “A little,” Harry said to his
//possibly-ultra-high-quality, perhaps-ridiculously-expensive Chinese tea. “I’m
//certainly becoming a bit __frustrated__ with… whatever’s going wrong in
//people’s heads.”

// 7677
//“Yes,” said that icy voice. “I find it frustrating as well.”

// 7678
//“Is there any way to get people __not__ to do that?” said Harry to his
//teacup.

// 7679
//“There is indeed a certain useful spell which solves the problem.”

// 7680
//Harry looked up hopefully at that, and saw a cold, cold smile on the Defense
//Professor’s face.

// 7681
//Then Harry got it. “I mean, __besides__ Avada Kedavra.”

// 7682
//The Defense Professor laughed. Harry didn’t.

// 7683
//“Anyway,” Harry said hastily, “I __did__ think fast enough not to suggest
//the obvious idea about the Resurrection Stone in front of Dumbledore. Have you
//ever seen a stone with a line, inside a circle, inside a triangle?”

// 7684
//The deathly chill seemed to draw back, fold into itself, as the ordinary
//Professor Quirrell returned. “Not that I can recall,” Professor Quirrell said
//after a while, a thoughtful frown on his face. “That is the Resurrection
//Stone?”

// 7685
//Harry set aside his teacup, then drew on his saucer the symbol he had seen on
//the inside of his cloak. And before Harry could take out his own wand to cast
//the Hover Charm, the saucer went floating obligingly across the table toward
//Professor Quirrell. Harry really wanted to learn that wandless stuff, but that,
//apparently, was far above his current curriculum.

// 7686
//Professor Quirrell studied Harry’s tea-saucer for a moment, then shook his
//head; and a moment later, the saucer went floating back to Harry.

// 7687
//Harry put his teacup back on the saucer, noting absently as he did so that the
//symbol he’d drawn had vanished. “If you happen to see a stone with that
//symbol,” said Harry, “and it __does__ talk to the afterlife, do let me
//know. I have a few questions for Merlin or anyone who was around in Atlantis.”

// 7688
//“Quite,” said Professor Quirrell. Then the Defense Professor lifted up his
//teacup again, and tipped it back as though to finish the last of what was
//there. “By the way, Mr. Potter, I fear we shall have to cut short today’s visit
//to Diagon Alley. I was hoping it would - but never mind. Let it stand that
//there is something else I must do this afternoon.”

// 7689
//Harry nodded, and finished his own tea, then rose from his seat at the same
//time as Professor Quirrell.

// 7690
//“One last question,” Harry said, as Professor Quirrell’s coat lifted itself off
//the coatrack and went floating toward the Defense Professor. “Magic is loose in
//the world, and I no longer trust my guesses so much as I once did. So in your
//own best guess and without any wishful thinking, do __you__ believe
//there’s an afterlife?”

// 7691
//“If I did, Mr. Potter,” said Professor Quirrell as he shrugged on his coat,
//“would I still be __here?__”
