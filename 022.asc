//== The Scientific Method

// 4099
//__Something, somewhere, somewhen, must have happened differently…__

// 4100
//PETUNIA EVANS married Michael Verres, a Professor of Biochemistry at Oxford.

// 4101
//HARRY JAMES POTTER-EVANS-VERRES grew up in a house filled to the brim with
//books. He once bit a math teacher who didn’t know what a logarithm was. He’s
//read __Godel, Escher, Bach__ and __Judgment Under Uncertainty:
//Heuristics and Biases__ and volume one of __The Feynman Lectures on
//Physics.__ And despite what everyone who’s met him seems to fear, he doesn’t
//want to become the next Dark Lord. He was raised better than that. He wants to
//discover the laws of magic and become a god.

// 4102
//HERMIONE GRANGER is doing better than him in every class except broomstick
//riding.

// 4103
//DRACO MALFOY is exactly what you would expect an eleven-year-old boy to be like
//if Darth Vader were his doting father.

// 4104
//PROFESSOR QUIRRELL is living his lifelong dream of teaching Defense Against the
//Dark Arts, or as he prefers to call his class, Battle Magic. His students are
//all wondering what’s going to go wrong with the Defense Professor this time.

// 4105
//DUMBLEDORE is either insane, or playing some vastly deeper game which involved
//setting fire to a chicken.

// 4106
//DEPUTY HEADMISTRESS MINERVA MCGONAGALL needs to go off somewhere private and
//scream for a while.

// 4107
//Presenting:

// 4108
//HARRY POTTER AND THE METHODS OF RATIONALITY

// 4109
//You ain’t guessin’ where this one’s going.

// 4110
//__Some notes:__

// 4111
//The opinions of characters in this story are not necessarily those of the
//author. What warm!Harry thinks is __often __meant as a good pattern to
//follow, especially if Harry thinks about how he can cite scientific studies to
//back up a particular principle. But not everything Harry does or thinks is a
//good idea. That wouldn’t work as a story. And the less warm characters may
//sometimes have valuable lessons to offer, but those lessons may also be
//dangerously double-edged.

// 4112
//If you haven’t visited **HPMOR DOT COM**, don’t forget to do that at some
//point; otherwise you’ll miss out on the fan art, how to learn everything Harry
//knows, and more.

// 4113
//If you haven’t just enjoyed this fic, but learned something from it, then
//please consider blogging it or tweeting it. A work like this only does as much
//good as there are people who read it.

// 4114
//__And now, back to your regularly scheduled fic…__

// 4115
//The key to strategy is not to choose __a__ path to J. K. Rowling, but to
//choose so that __all__ paths lead to a J. K. Rowling.

// 4116
//A small study room, near but not in the Ravenclaw dorm, one of the many many
//unused rooms of Hogwarts. Gray stone the floors, red brick the walls, dark
//stained wood the ceiling, four glowing glass globes set into the four walls of
//the room. A circular table that looked like a wide slab of black marble set on
//thick black marble legs for columns, but which had proved to be very light
//(weight and mass both) and wasn’t difficult to pick up and move around if
//necessary. Two comfortably cushioned chairs which had seemed at first to be
//locked to the floor in inconvenient places, but which would, the two of them
//had finally discovered, scoot around to where you stood as soon as you leaned
//over in a posture that looked like you were about to sit down.

// 4117
//There also seemed to be a number of bats flying around the room.

// 4118
//That was where, future historians would one day record - __if__ the whole
//project ever actually amounted to anything - the scientific study of magic had
//begun, with two young first-year Hogwarts students.

// 4119
//Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, theorist.

// 4120
//And Hermione Jean Granger, experimenter and test subject.

// 4121
//Harry was doing better in classes now, at least the classes he considered
//interesting. He’d read more books, and not books for eleven-year-olds either.
//He’d practiced Transfiguration over and over during one of his extra hours
//every day, taking the other hour for beginning Occlumency. He was taking the
//worthwhile classes __seriously,__ not just turning in his homework every
//day, but using his free time to learn more than was required, to read other
//books beyond the given textbooks, looking to master the subject and not just
//memorize a few test answers, to excel. You didn’t see that much outside
//Ravenclaw. And now even __within__ Ravenclaw, his only remaining
//competitors were Padma Patil (whose parents came from a non-English-speaking
//culture and thus had raised her with an actual work ethic), Anthony Goldstein
//(out of a certain tiny ethnic group that won 25// of the Nobel Prizes), and of
//course, striding far above everyone like a Titan strolling through a pack of
//puppies, Hermione Granger.

// 4122
//To run this particular experiment you needed the test subject to learn sixteen
//new spells, on their own, without help or correction. That meant the test
//subject was Hermione. Period.

// 4123
//It should be mentioned at this point that the bats flying around the room were
//__not__ glowing.

// 4124
//Harry was having trouble accepting the implications of this.

// 4125
//“__Oogely boogely!__” Hermione said again.

// 4126
//Again, at the tip of Hermione’s wand, there was the abrupt, transitionless
//appearance of a bat. One moment, empty air. The next moment, bat. Its wings
//seemed to be already moving in the instant when it appeared.

// 4127
//And it __still wasn’t glowing.__

// 4128
//“Can I stop now?” said Hermione.

// 4129
//“Are you sure,” Harry said through what seemed to be a block in his throat,
//“that maybe with a bit more practice you couldn’t get it to glow?” He was
//violating the experimental procedure he’d written down beforehand, which was a
//sin, and he was violating it because he didn’t like the results he was getting,
//which was a __mortal__ sin, you could go to Science Hell for that, but it
//didn’t seem to be mattering anyway.

// 4130
//“What did you change this time?” Hermione said, sounding a little weary.

// 4131
//“The durations of the __oo,__ __eh,__ and __ee__ sounds. It’s
//supposed to be 3 to 2 to 2, not 3 to 1 to 1.”

// 4132
//“__Oogely boogely!__” said Hermione.

// 4133
//The bat materialized with only one wing and spun pathetically to the floor,
//flopping around in a circle on the gray stone.

// 4134
//“Now what is it really?” said Hermione.

// 4135
//“3 to 2 to 1.”

// 4136
//“__Oogely boogely!__”

// 4137
//This time the bat didn’t have any wings at all and fell with a plop like a dead
//mouse.

// 4138
//“3 to 1 to 2.”

// 4139
//And lo the bat did materialize and it did fly up at once toward the ceiling,
//healthy and glowing a bright green.

// 4140
//Hermione nodded in satisfaction. “Okay, what next?”

// 4141
//There was a long pause.

// 4142
//“__Seriously?__ You __seriously__ have to say __Oogely boogely__
//with the duration of the __oo,__ __eh,__ and __ee__ sounds
//having a ratio of 3 to 1 to 2, or the bat won’t glow? __Why? Why? For the
//love of all that is sacred, why?__”

// 4143
//“Why not?”

// 4144
//“__AAAAAAAAARRRRRRGHHHH!__”

// 4145
//__Thud. Thud. Thud.__

// 4146
//Harry had thought about the nature of magic for a while, and then designed a
//series of experiments based on the premise that virtually everything wizards
//believed about magic was wrong.

// 4147
//You couldn’t __really__ need to say ‘Wingardium Leviosa’ in exactly the
//right way in order to levitate something, because, come on, ‘Wingardium
//Leviosa’? The universe was going to check that you said ‘Wingardium Leviosa’ in
//exactly the right way and otherwise it wouldn’t make the quill float?

// 4148
//No. Obviously no, once you thought about it seriously. Someone, quite possibly
//an actual preschool child, but at any rate some English-speaking magic user,
//who thought that ‘Wingardium Leviosa’ sounded all flyish and floaty, had
//originally spoken those words while casting the spell for the first time. And
//then told everyone else it was necessary.

// 4149
//But (Harry had reasoned) it didn’t __have__ to be that way, it wasn’t
//built into the universe, it was built into __you__.

// 4150
//There was an old story passed down among scientists, a cautionary tale, the
//story of Blondlot and the N-Rays.

// 4151
//Shortly after the discovery of X-Rays, an eminent French physicist named
//Prosper-Rene Blondlot - who had been first to measure the speed of radio waves
//and show that they propagated at the speed of light - had announced the
//discovery of an amazing new phenomenon, N-Rays, which would induce a faint
//brightening of a screen. You had to look hard to see it, but it was there.
//N-Rays had all sorts of interesting properties. They were bent by aluminium and
//could be focused by an aluminium prism into striking a treated thread of
//cadmium sulfide, which would then glow faintly in the dark…

// 4152
//Soon dozens of other scientists had confirmed Blondlot’s results, especially in
//France.

// 4153
//But there were still other scientists, in England and Germany, who said they
//weren’t quite sure they could see that faint glow.

// 4154
//Blondlot had said they were probably setting up the machinery wrong.

// 4155
//One day Blondlot had given a demonstration of N-Rays. The lights had turned
//out, and his assistant had called off the brightening and darkening as Blondlot
//performed his manipulations.

// 4156
//It had been a normal demonstration, all the results going as expected.

// 4157
//Even though an American scientist named Robert Wood had quietly stolen the
//aluminium prism from the center of Blondlot’s mechanism.

// 4158
//And that had been the end of N-Rays.

// 4159
//__Reality,__ Philip K. Dick had once said, __is that which, when you
//stop believing in it, doesn’t go away.__

// 4160
//Blondlot’s sin had been obvious in retrospect. He shouldn’t have told his
//assistant what he was doing. Blondlot should have made sure the assistant
//__didn’t__ know what was being tried or when it was being tried, before
//asking him to describe the screen’s brightness. It could have been that simple.

// 4161
//Nowadays it was called “blinding” and it was one of the things modern
//scientists took for granted. If you were doing a psychology experiment to see
//whether people got angrier when they were hit over the head with red truncheons
//than with green truncheons, you didn’t get to look at the subjects yourself and
//decide how “angry” they were. You would snap photos of them after they’d been
//hit with the truncheon, and send the photos off to a panel of raters, who would
//rate on a scale of 1 to 10 how angry each person looked, obviously
//__without__ knowing what color of truncheon they’d been hit with. Indeed
//there was no good reason to tell the raters what the experiment was about, at
//all. You __certainly__ wouldn’t tell the experimental subjects that
//__you thought__ they ought to be angrier when hit by red truncheons. You’d
//just offer them 20 pounds, lure them into a test room, hit them with a
//truncheon, color randomly assigned of course, and snap the photo. In fact the
//truncheon-hitting and photo-snapping would be done by an assistant who hadn’t
//been told about the hypothesis, so he couldn’t look expectant, hit harder, or
//snap the photo at just the right time.

// 4162
//Blondlot had destroyed his reputation with the sort of mistake that would get a
//failing grade and probably derisive laughter from the T.A. in a first-year
//undergraduate course on experimental design… in 1991.

// 4163
//But this had been a bit longer ago, in 1904, and so it had taken months before
//Robert Wood had formulated the obvious alternative hypothesis and figured out
//how to test it, and dozens of other scientists had been sucked in.

// 4164
//More than two centuries after science had gotten started. That late in
//scientific history, it still hadn’t been obvious.

// 4165
//Which made it __entirely__ plausible that in the tiny wizarding world,
//where science didn’t seem much known at all, no one had ever tried the first,
//the simplest, the most obvious thing that any modern scientist would think to
//check.

// 4166
//The books were full of complicated instructions for all the things you had to
//do __exactly right__ in order to cast a spell. And, Harry had
//hypothesized, the process of obeying those instructions, of checking that you
//were following them correctly, probably __did__ do something. It
//__forced you to concentrate on the spell__. Being told to just wave your
//wand and wish probably __wouldn’t__ work as well. And once you believed
//the spell was supposed to work a certain way, once you had practiced it that
//way, you might not be able to convince yourself that it could work any
//__other__ way…

// 4167
//…if you did the simple but wrong thing, and tried to test alternative forms
//__yourself.__

// 4168
//But what if you __didn’t know__ what the original spell had been like?

// 4169
//What if you gave Hermione a list of spells she hadn’t studied yet, taken from a
//book of silly prank spells in the Hogwarts library, and some of those spells
//had the correct and original instructions, while others had one changed
//gesture, one changed word? What if you kept the instructions constant, but told
//her that a spell supposed to create a red worm was supposed to create a blue
//worm instead?

// 4170
//Well, in that case, it had turned out…

// 4171
//…Harry was having trouble believing his results here…

// 4172
//…if you told Hermione to say “Oogely boogely” with the vowel durations in the
//ratio of 3 to 1 to 1, instead of the correct ratio of 3 to 1 to 2, you still
//got the bat but it wouldn’t glow any more.

// 4173
//Not that belief was __irrelevant__ here. Not that __only__ the words
//and wand movements mattered.

// 4174
//If you gave Hermione completely incorrect information about what a spell was
//supposed to do, it would stop working.

// 4175
//If you didn’t tell her at all what the spell was supposed to do, it would stop
//working.

// 4176
//If she knew in very vague terms what the spell was supposed to do, or she was
//only partially wrong, then the spell would work as originally described in the
//book, not the way she’d been told it should.

// 4177
//Harry was, at this moment, literally banging his head against the brick wall.
//Not hard. He didn’t want to damage his precious brains. But if he didn’t have
//some outlet for his frustration, he would spontaneously catch on fire.

// 4178
//__Thud. Thud. Thud.__

// 4179
//It seemed the universe actually __did__ want you to say ‘Wingardium
//Leviosa’ and it wanted you to say it in a certain exact way and it didn’t care
//what __you__ thought the pronunciation should be any more than it cared
//how you felt about gravity.

// 4180
//__WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?__

// 4181
//The worst part of it was the smug, amused look on Hermione’s face.

// 4182
//Hermione had __not__ been okay with sitting around obediently following
//Harry’s instructions without being told why.

// 4183
//So Harry had explained to her what they were testing.

// 4184
//Harry had explained why they were testing it.

// 4185
//Harry had explained why probably no wizard had tried it before them.

// 4186
//Harry had explained that he was actually fairly confident of his prediction.

// 4187
//Because, Harry had said, there was __no way__ that the universe actually
//wanted you to say ‘Wingardium Leviosa’.

// 4188
//Hermione had pointed out that this was not what her books said. Hermione had
//asked if Harry really thought he was smarter, at eleven years old and just over
//a month into his Hogwarts education, than all the other wizards in the world
//who disagreed with him.

// 4189
//Harry had said the following exact words:

// 4190
//“Of course.”

// 4191
//Now Harry was staring at the red brick directly in front of him and
//contemplating how hard he would have to hit his head in order to give himself a
//concussion that would interfere with long-term memory formation and prevent him
//from remembering this later. Hermione wasn’t laughing, but he could feel her
//__intent to laugh__ radiating out from behind him like a dreadful pressure
//on his skin, sort of like knowing you were being stalked by a serial killer
//only __worse.__

// 4192
//“Say it,” Harry said.

// 4193
//“I wasn’t __going__ to,” said the kindly voice of Hermione Granger. “It
//didn’t seem nice.”
-- Я не __збиралася__, -- пролунав лагідний голосок Герміони Ґрейнджер. --
це було б нечемно.

// 4194
//“Just get it over with,” said Harry.
-- Давай вже, покінчимо з цим, -- наполягав Гаррі. 

// 4195
//“Okay! So you gave me this __whole long lecture__ about how hard it was to
//do basic science and how we might need to stay on the problem for
//__thirty-five years__, and then you went and expected us to make the
//greatest discovery in the history of magic in the first hour we were working
//together. You didn’t just hope, you really expected it. You’re silly.”
-- Ну добре! Тож ти прочитав мені цю __довжелезну лекцію__ про те, як це важко
-- займатися наукою, і як нам, може, __тридцять п’ять років__
знадобиться на віришення одного завдання, а потім всерйоз очікував, що ми
зробимо найбільше відкриття за всю історію магії вже в першу годину сумісної
праці. Ти не просто сподівався цього, ти цього очікував. Ти дурень.

// 4196
//“Thank you. Now -”
-- Дякую. А тепер...

// 4197
//“I’ve read all the books you gave me and I still don’t know what to call that.
//Overconfidence? Planning fallacy? Super duper Lake Wobegon effect? They’ll have
//to name it after you. Harry Bias.”
-- Я прочитала всі книжки, що ти мені дав, і досі не знаю, яким словом це
назвати. Надмірна самовпевненість? Омана планування? Супер-пупер ілюзорна зверхність? Доведеться назвати на твою
честь. Омана Гаррі.
//@Lake Wobegon effect=Illusory Superiority== Ілюзорна зверхність, але цей
//переклад пропонує вікіпедія.

// 4198
//“All __right!__”
-- Ну __годі!__

// 4199
//“But it __is__ cute. It’s such a boy thing to do.”
-- Втім це __миленько__. Така хлопчача поведінка.

// 4200
//“__Drop dead.__”
__Помри.__

// 4201
//“Aw, you say the most romantic things.”
-- О, Гаррі, який ти романтичний.

// 4202
//__Thud. Thud. Thud.__
__Геп. Геп. Геп.__

// 4203
//“So what’s next?” said Hermione.
-- То що тепер? -- спитала Герміона.

// 4204
//Harry rested his head against the bricks. His forehead was starting to hurt
//where he’d been banging it. “Nothing. I have to go back and design different
//experiments.”

Гаррі сперся головою об стіну. Його лоб почав боліти там, де він їм
стукався.

-- Нічого. Я маю повернутися на початок і розробити інші експерименти.

// 4205
//Over the last month, Harry had carefully worked out, in advance, a course of
//experimentation for them that would have lasted until December.
Протягом останнього місяця Гаррі зазделегідь був розпланував хід усіх
експериментів, яких їм мало б вистачити до грудня.

// 4206
//It would have been a __great__ set of experiments if the __very
//first test__ had not falsified the basic premise.
Це була б __чудова__ серія експериментів, якби тільки __найперший тест__ не
спростував базове припущення. 

// 4207
//Harry could not believe he had been this dumb.
Гаррі повірити не міг, що він був настільки тупим.

// 4208
//“Let me correct myself,” said Harry. “I need to design __one__ new
//experiment. I’ll let you know when we’ve got it, and we’ll do it, and then I’ll
//design the next one. How does that sound?”
-- Ні, не так, -- сказав Гаррі. -- Мені треба розробити
__один__ новий дослід. Я дам тобі знати, коли все буде готово, ми його
проведемо, а тоді я розроблю наступний. Як це звучить?

// 4209
//“It sounds like __someone__ wasted a __whole lot of effort__.”
-- Це звучить так, ніби __хтось__ змарнував __силу-силенну зусиль__.

// 4210
//__Thud.__ Ow. He’d done that a bit harder than he’d planned.
__Геп.__ Оєю. Вийшло трохи сильніше, ніж він розраховував.

// 4211
//“So,” said Hermione. She was leaning back in her chair and the smug look was
//back on her face. “What did we discover today?”
-- Отож, -- продовжила Герміона. Вона відкинулася назад у кріслі, а на її обличчі
знов заграла самовдоволена посмішка. -- Чого ми дізналися сьогодні?

// 4212
//“I discovered,” said Harry through gritted teeth, “that when it comes to doing
//truly basic research on a genuinely confusing problem where you have no clue
//what’s going on, my books on scientific methodology aren’t worth crap -”
-- Я дізнався, -- вимовив Гаррі крізь стиснуті зуби, -- що, коли йдеться про
найбазовіше дослідження дійсно заплутаної проблеми, в якій ти анічогісінько не
розумієш, мої книжки з наукової методології -- це купа лайна...

// 4213
//“Language, Mr. Potter! Some of us are innocent young girls!”
-- Стежте за мовою, містере Поттер! Дехто з нас -- наївні дівчини!

// 4214
//“Fine. But if my books were worth a __carp,__ that’s a kind of fish not
//anything bad, they would have given me the following important piece of advice:
//When there’s a confusing problem and you’re just starting out and you have a
//falsifiable hypothesis, go test it. Find some simple, easy way of doing a basic
//check and do it right away. Don’t worry about designing an elaborate course of
//experiments that would make a grant proposal look impressive to a funding
//agency. Just check as fast as possible whether your ideas are false before you
//start investing huge amounts of effort in them. How does that sound for a
//moral?”
-- Добре. Але якби мої книжки не були купою __лайок__, і лайка -- це такий
пес, нічого такого, вони дали б мені таку важливу пораду: коли перед тобою
заплутана проблема, і ти на самому початку, і в тебе на руках є теорія, що її
можна спростувати, то йди і протестуй її. Знайди якийсь простий, легкий спосіб,
в який можеш провести базову перевірку, і зроби це одразу. Не переймайся
підготовкою серії детальних експериментів, які зроблять твою заявку на грант більш
вагомою в очах наукового фонду. Просто якомога швидше перевір, чи раптом твої ідеї
не хибні, перш ніж почати вкладати в них багато зусиль. Як тобі така
мораль сьогоднішньої казки?

// 4215
//“Mmm… okay,” said Hermione. “But I was also hoping for something like
//‘Hermione’s books aren’t worthless. They’re written by wise old wizards who
//know way more about magic than I do. I should pay attention to what Hermione’s
//books say.’ Can we have that moral too?”
--Гммм... нічого так, -- сказала Герміона. -- Проте я сподівалася чогось на
кшталт: "`Книжки Герміони чогось та варті. Вони були написані велемудрими
чаклунами, які знають про магію значно більше, ніж я. Я маю зважати на те, що
пишеться в Герміоніних книжках`". Можна ми додамо це до моралі?

// 4216
//Harry’s jaw seemed to be clenched too tightly to let any words out, so he just
//nodded.
Гарріни щелепи були зціплені занадто щільно, щоб пропустити якісь слова, тож
він просто кивнув.

// 4217
//“Great!” Hermione said. “I liked this experiment. We learned a lot from it and
//it only took me an hour or so.”
--Чудово! -- сказала Герміона. -- Мені сподобався цей експеримент. Ми багато
чого з нього дізналися, і на це пішла лише десь година мого часу.

// 4218
//“AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!”
-- ААААААААААААААААААААААААААААА!

//In the dungeons of Slytherin.
У підземеллях Слизерину.

//An unused classroom lit with eerie green light, much brighter this time and
//coming from a small crystal globe with a temporary enchantment, but eerie green
//light nonetheless, casting strange shadows from the dusty desks.
Незайняту класну кімнату освітлювало моторошне зелене світло. Цього разу воно
виходило з тимчасово заклятої кришталевої кулі і було значно яскравішим, та все
одно -- моторошним і зеленим. Вкриті порохом столи відкидали химерні тіні.

//Draco Malfoy hadn’t been sure if he should look forward to it or not.

Гаррі Поттер, судячи з виразу його обличчя, не мав жодних сумнівів щодо

// 4225
//Harry Potter looked like he was ready to kill someone.
Гаррі Поттер мав такий вигляд, наче був готовий когось вбити.

// 4226
//“Hermione Granger,” said Harry Potter, just as Draco was opening his mouth.
//“__Don’t ask__.”
-- Герміона Ґрейнджер, -- промовив Гаррі Поттер, тільки-но Драко відкрив рота.
-- __Не питай__.

// 4227
//__He couldn’t have gone on another date, could he?__ thought Draco, but
//that didn’t make any sense.
__Може, він ходив на ще одне побачення?__ подумав Драко, але це видавалося
повним безглуздям.

// 4228
//“Harry,” said Draco, “I’m sorry but I have to ask this anyway, did you

-- Гаррі, -- сказав Драко, -- мені шкода, але я все одно маю спитати, ти

//“Yes, I did. You’ve already worked out why, of course.”
-- Так, замовив. І ти безсумнівно вже зрозумів, чому.

// 4230
//Draco reached up and raked fingers through his hair in frustration, his cowl
//brushing the back of his hand. He __hadn’t__ been quite sure why, but now
//he couldn’t say so. And Slytherin __knew__ he was courting Harry Potter,
//he’d made it obvious enough in Defense class. “Harry,” said Draco, “people know
//I’m friends with you, they don’t know about the Conspiracy of course, but they
//know we’re friends, and it makes __me__ look bad when you do that sort of
//thing.”
Драко застромив руки під каптур і розпачливо вчепився собі у волосся. Він
__не розумів__ чому, але тепер не міг в цьому
зізнатися. До того ж слизеринці __знали__ що він упадає за Гаррі Поттером, він
відкрито це продемонстрував на уроці захисту. 

-- Гаррі, -- сказав Драко, -- люди знають,
що я дружу з тобою;  вони, звісно, нічого не знають про Таємне Товариство, та
вони знають, що ми друзі, і __я__ виглядаю погано, коли ти починаєш таке
виробляти.

// 4231
//Harry Potter’s face tightened. “Anyone in Slytherin who can’t understand the
//concept of acting nice toward people you don’t actually like should be ground
//up and fed to pet snakes.”
Обличчя Гаррі Поттера посуворішало. 

-- Будь-хто в Слизерині, хто не здатний
зрозуміти концепцію чемного ставлення до людей, які тобі насправді не подобаються, має
бути ізольований, а тоді згодований ручним зміям.

// 4232
//“There are a lot of people in Slytherin who __don’t,__” Draco said, his
//voice serious. “Most people are stupid, and you have to look good in front of
//them anyway.” Harry Potter __had__ to understand that if he ever wanted to
//get anywhere in life.
-- Багато хто в Слизерині __не розуміє__,-- сказав Драко, вкрай серйозно. --
Більшість людей  -- дурні, та в їх очах теж треба добре виглядати. 

Гаррі
Поттер __мусив__ зрозуміти це, якщо він хотів бодай чогось досягти в житті.

// 4233
//“What do __you__ care what other people think? Are you really going to
//live your life needing to explain everything you do to the dumbest idiots in
//Slytherin, letting __them__ judge __you?__ I’m sorry, Draco, but I’m
//not lowering my cunning plots to the level of what the dumbest Slytherins can
//understand, just because it might make you look bad otherwise. Not even your
//friendship is worth that. It would __take all the fun out of life.__ Tell
//me __you__ haven’t ever thought the same thing when someone in Slytherin
//is being too stupid to breathe, that it’s beneath the dignity of a Malfoy to
//have to pander to them.”
-- А __що__ тобі до того, що подумають інші? Невже ти дійсно збираєшся все життя
роз’яснювати свої дії найтупішім недоумкам Слизерину, невже дозволиш __їм__
судити __тебе__? Вибач, Драко, але я не зводитиму свої хитрі задуми до такого
рівня, щоб вони були зрозумілі найтупішим слизеринцям, і це лишень щоб
вони на тебе погано не подумали. Навіть твоя дружба того не варта. Це б
__позбавило життя будь-якого сенсу__.  Тільки не кажи мені, що __тобі__ ніколи
не спадало на думку, що дехто в Слизерині надто дурний, щоб дихати, і що
нащадкові Мелфоїв не гідно догоджати таким.

// 4234
//Draco genuinely hadn’t. Ever. Pandering to idiots was like breathing, you did
//it without thinking about it.
Щиро кажучи, Драко не спадало. Ніколи. Догоджати ідіотам -- це як дихати:
робиш це не замислюючись.

// 4235
//“Harry,” Draco said at last. “Just doing whatever you want, without worrying
//about how it looks, isn’t smart. The __Dark Lord__ worried about how he
//looked! He was feared and hated, and he knew __exactly__ what sort of fear
//and hate he wanted to create. __Everyone__ has to worry about what other
//people think.”
-- Гаррі, -- нарешті промовив Драко, -- просто робити, що заманеться, не
піклуючись
про те, як це виглядає -- це не розумна поведінка. Сам  __Темний Лорд__
піклувався
про те,як він виглядає! Його боялися, і ненавиділи, і він __точно__ знав, який
саме страх, та яку саме ненависть він хотів викликати. __Всі__ мають
піклуватися про думку інших людей.

// 4236
//The cowled figure shrugged. “Perhaps. Remind me sometime to tell you about
//something called Asch’s Conformity Experiment, you might find it quite amusing.
//For now I’ll just note that it’s dangerous to worry about what other people
//think on __instinct,__ because you __actually care,__ not as a matter
//of cold-blooded calculation. Remember, I was beaten and bullied by older
//Slytherins for fifteen minutes, and afterward I stood up and graciously forgave
//them. Just like the good and virtuous Boy-Who-Lived ought to do. But my
//cold-blooded calculations, Draco, tell me that I have __no use__ for the
//dumbest idiots in Slytherin, since __I don’t own a pet snake.__ So I have
//no reason to care what they think about how I conduct my duel with Hermione
//Granger.”
Постать у каптурі стенула плечима. 

-- Мабуть. Нагадай мені якось розповісти тобі про експеримент Аша, тобі це може
бути цікаво. Наразі я лише зазначу, що небезпечно хвилюватися через
думку інших людей __інстинктивно__, а не через холоднокровний розрахунок.
Пам’ятаєш, старші слизеринці впродовж п’ятнадцяти хвилин били і збиткувалися з
мене, а після цього я встав і люб’язно пробачив їм. Так, як і мав зробити
добрий і чеснотливий Хлопчик-Що-Вижив. Проте мій холоднокровний розрахунок,
Драко, каже, що мені __ні до чого__ найтупіші недоумки Слизерину,
оскільки __ в мене нема ручної змії__. Відповідно, в мене нема причини
опікуватися їхньою думкою про те, як саме я проваджу дуель з Герміоною
Ґрейнджер.

// 4237
//Draco did not clench his fists in frustration. “She’s just some mudblood,”
//Draco said, keeping his voice calm, rather than shouting. “If you don’t like
//her, push her down the stairs.”

// 4238
//“Ravenclaw would know -”

// 4239
//“Have Pansy Parkinson push her down the stairs! You wouldn’t even have to
//manipulate her, offer her a Sickle and she’d do it!”

// 4240
//“__I__ would know! Hermione beat me in a book-reading contest, she’s
//getting better grades than me, I have to defeat her with my __brain__ or
//it doesn’t count!”

// 4241
//“__She’s just a mudblood! Why do you respect her that much?__”

// 4242
//“__She’s a power among Ravenclaws! Why do you care what some powerless
//idiot in Slytherin thinks?__”

// 4243
//“__It’s called politics! And if you can’t play it you can’t have power!__”

// 4244
//“__Walking on the moon is power! Being a great wizard is power! There are
//kinds of power that don’t require me to spend the rest of my life pandering to
//morons!__”

// 4245
//Both of them stopped, and, in almost perfect unison, began taking deep breaths
//to calm themselves.

// 4246
//“Sorry,” Harry Potter said after a few moments, wiping sweat from his forehead.
//“Sorry, Draco. You’ve got a lot of political power and it makes sense for you
//to keep it. You __should__ be calculating what Slytherin thinks. It’s an
//important game and I shouldn’t have insulted it. But you can’t ask __me__
//to lower the level of my game in Ravenclaw, just so that you don’t look bad by
//associating with me. Tell Slytherin you’re gritting your teeth while you
//pretend to be my friend.”

// 4247
//That was exactly what Draco __had__ told Slytherin, and he still wasn’t
//sure whether it was true.

// 4248
//“Anyway,” Draco said. “Speaking of your image. I’m afraid I’ve got some bad
//news. Rita Skeeter heard some of the stories about you and she’s been asking
//questions.”

// 4249
//Harry Potter raised his eyebrows. “Who?”

// 4250
//“She writes for the __Daily Prophet,__” Draco said. He tried to keep the
//worry out of his voice. The __Daily Prophet__ was one of Father’s primary
//tools, he used it like a wizard’s wand. “That’s the newspaper people actually
//pay attention to. Rita Skeeter writes about celebrities, and as she puts it,
//uses her quill to puncture their over-inflated reputations. If she can’t find
//any rumors about you, she’ll just make up her own.”

// 4251
//“I __see,__” said Harry Potter. His green-lit face looked very thoughtful
//beneath the cowl.

// 4252
//Draco hesitated before saying what he had to say next. By now someone had
//certainly reported to Father that he was courting Harry Potter, and Father
//would also know that Draco hadn’t written home about it, and Father would
//understand that Draco didn’t think he could actually keep it a secret, which
//sent a clear message that Draco was practicing his own game now but still on
//Father’s side, since if Draco had been tempted away, he would have been sending
//false reports.

// 4253
//It followed that Father had probably anticipated what Draco was about to say
//next.

// 4254
//Playing the game with Father for real was a rather unnerving sensation. Even if
//they were on the same side. It was, on the one hand, exhiliarating, but Draco
//also knew that in the end it would turn out that Father had played the game
//better. There was no other way it could possibly go.

// 4255
//“Harry,” Draco finally said. “This isn’t a suggestion. This isn’t my advice.
//Just the way it is. My father could almost certainly quash that article. But it
//would cost you.”

// 4256
//That Father had been expecting Draco to tell Harry Potter exactly that was not
//something Draco said out loud. Harry Potter would work it out on his own, or
//not.

// 4257
//But instead Harry Potter shook his head, smiling beneath the cowl. “I have no
//intention of trying to quash Rita Skeeter.”

// 4258
//Draco didn’t even try to keep the incredulity out of his voice. “You
//__can’t__ tell me you don’t care what the __newspaper__ says about
//you!”

// 4259
//“I care less than you might think,” said Harry Potter. “But I have my own ways
//of dealing with the likes of Skeeter. I don’t need Lucius’s help.”

// 4260
//A worried look came over Draco’s face before he could stop it. Whatever Harry
//Potter was about to do next, it would be something Father wasn’t expecting, and
//Draco was feeling very nervous about where that might lead.

// 4261
//Draco also realized that his hair was getting sweaty underneath the cowl. He’d
//never actually worn one of those before, and hadn’t realized that the Death
//Eaters’ cloaks probably had things like Cooling Charms.

// 4262
//Harry Potter wiped some sweat from his forehead again, grimaced, took out his
//wand, pointed it upward, took a deep breath, and said “__Frigideiro!__”

// 4263
//Moments later Draco felt the cold draft.

// 4264
//“__Frigideiro! Frigideiro! Frigideiro! Frigideiro! Frigideiro!__”

// 4265
//Then Harry Potter lowered the wand, though his hand seemed a bit shaky, and put
//it back into his robes.

// 4266
//The whole room seemed perceptibly cooler. Draco could have done that too, but
//still, not bad.

// 4267
//“So,” Draco said. “Science. You’re going to tell me about blood.”

// 4268
//“We’re going to __find out__ about blood,” Harry Potter said. “By doing
//experiments.”

// 4269
//“All right,” Draco said. “What sort of experiments?”

// 4270
//Harry Potter smiled evilly beneath his cowl, and said, “You tell me.”

// 4271
//Draco had heard of something called the Socratic Method, which was teaching by
//asking questions (named after an ancient philosopher who had been too smart to
//be a real Muggle and hence had been a disguised pureblood wizard). One of his
//tutors had used Socratic teaching a lot. It had been annoying but effective.

// 4272
//Then there was the Potter Method, which was insane.

// 4273
//To be fair, Draco had to admit that Harry Potter had tried the Socratic Method
//first and it hadn’t been working too well.

// 4274
//Harry Potter had asked how Draco would go about __disproving__ the blood
//purist hypothesis that wizards couldn’t do the neat stuff now that they’d done
//eight centuries ago because they had interbred with Muggleborns and Squibs.

// 4275
//Draco had said that he did not understand how Harry Potter could sit there with
//a straight face and claim this was not a trap.

// 4276
//Harry Potter had replied, still with a straight face, that if it was a trap it
//would have been so pathetically obvious that __he__ ought to be ground up
//and fed to pet snakes, but it was __not__ a trap, it was simply a rule of
//how scientists operated that you had to try to disprove your own theories, and
//if you made an honest effort and failed, that was victory.

// 4277
//Draco had tried to point out the staggering stupidity of this by suggesting
//that the key to surviving a duel was to cast Avada Kedavra on your own foot and
//miss.

// 4278
//Harry Potter had __nodded__.

// 4279
//Draco had shaken his head.

// 4280
//Harry Potter had then presented the idea that scientists watched ideas fight to
//see which ones won, and you __couldn’t fight without an opponent,__ so
//Draco needed to figure out opponents for the blood purist hypothesis to fight
//so that blood purism could win, which Draco understood a little better even
//though Harry Potter had said it with a rather distasteful look. Like, it was
//clear that if blood purism was the way the world really was, then the sky just
//had to be blue, and if some other theory was true, the sky just had to be
//green; and nobody had seen the sky yet; and then you went outside and looked
//and the blood purists won; and after this had happened six times in a row,
//people would start noticing the trend.

// 4281
//Harry Potter had then proceeded to claim that all the opponents Draco was
//inventing were too weak, so blood purism wouldn’t get credit for defeating them
//because the battle wouldn’t be impressive enough. Draco had understood that
//too. __Wizards have gotten weaker because house elves are stealing our
//magic__ hadn’t sounded impressive to him either.

// 4282
//(Though Harry Potter __had__ said that one at least was testable, in that
//they could try to check if house elves had gotten stronger over time, and even
//draw a picture representing the increasing strength of house elves and another
//picture representing the decreasing strength of wizards and if the two pictures
//matched that would point to the house elves, all said in such completely
//serious tones that Draco had felt an impulse to ask Dobby a few pointed
//questions under Veritaserum before snapping out of it.)

// 4283
//And Harry Potter had finally said that Draco __couldn’t__ fix the battle,
//scientists weren’t dumb, it would be __obvious__ if you fixed the battle,
//it had to be a __real fight,__ between two different theories that might
//both __really__ be true, with a test that only the __true__
//hypothesis would win, something that actually __would__ come out different
//ways depending on which hypothesis was actually correct, and there would be
//experienced scientists watching to make sure that was exactly what happened.
//Harry Potter had claimed that he himself just wanted to know __how blood
//really worked__ and for that he need to see blood purism __really win__ and
//Draco wasn’t going to fool __him__ with theories that were just there to
//be knocked down.

// 4284
//Even having seen the point, Draco hadn’t been able to invent any “plausible
//alternatives”, as Harry Potter put it, to the idea that wizards were getting
//less powerful because they were mixing their blood with mud. It was too
//obviously true.

// 4285
//It was then that Harry Potter had said, rather frustrated, that he couldn’t
//imagine Draco was __really__ this bad at considering different viewpoints,
//__surely__ there’d been Death Eaters who’d posed as enemies of blood
//purism and had come up with much more plausible-sounding arguments against
//their own side than Draco was offering. If Draco had been trying to pose as a
//member of Dumbledore’s faction, and come up with the house elf hypothesis, he
//wouldn’t have fooled anyone for a second.

// 4286
//Draco had been forced to admit this was a point.

// 4287
//Hence the Potter Method.

// 4288
//“Please, Dr. Malfoy,” whined Harry Potter, “why won’t you accept my paper?”

// 4289
//Harry Potter had needed to repeat the phrase “just pretend to be pretending to
//be a scientist” three times before Draco had understood.

// 4290
//In that moment Draco had realized that there was something deeply
//__wrong__ with Harry Potter’s brain, and anyone who tried Legilimency on
//it would probably never come back out again.

// 4291
//Harry Potter had then gone into further and considerable detail: Draco was to
//pretend to be a Death Eater who was posing as the editor of a scientific
//journal, Dr. Malfoy, who wanted to reject his enemy Dr. Potter’s paper “On the
//Heritability of Magical Ability”, and if the Death Eater didn’t act like a real
//scientist would, he would be revealed as a Death Eater and executed, while Dr.
//Malfoy was also being watched by his own rivals and needed to __appear__
//to reject Dr. Potter’s paper for neutral scientific reasons or he would lose
//his position as journal editor.

// 4292
//It was a wonder the Sorting Hat wasn’t gibbering madly in St. Mungo’s.

// 4293
//It was also the most complicated thing anyone had __ever__ asked Draco to
//pretend and there was no possible way he could have refused the challenge.

// 4294
//Right now they were, as Harry Potter had put it, getting in the mood.

// 4295
//“I’m afraid, Dr. Potter, that you wrote this in the wrong color of ink,” Draco
//said. “Next!”

// 4296
//Dr. Potter’s face did an excellent job of crumpling in despair, and Draco
//couldn’t help but feel a flash of Dr. Malfoy’s glee, even though the Death
//Eater was only pretending to be Dr. Malfoy.

// 4297
//This part was __fun.__ He could have done this all day long.

// 4298
//Dr. Potter got up from the chair, slumped over in dismay, and trudged off, and
//turned into Harry Potter, who gave Draco a thumbs-up, and then turned back into
//Dr. Potter again, now approaching with an eager smile.

// 4299
//Dr. Potter sat down and presented Dr. Malfoy with a piece of parchment on which
//was written:

// 4300
//__On the Heritability of Magical Ability__

// 4301
//__Dr. H. J. Potter-Evans-Verres, Institute for Sufficiently Advanced
//Science__

// 4302
//__My observation:__

// 4303
//__Today’s wizards can’t do things as impressive as__

// 4304
//__what wizards used to do 800 years ago.__

// 4305
//__My conclusion:__

// 4306
//__Wizardkind has become weaker by mixing__

// 4307
//__their blood with Muggleborns and Squibs.__

// 4308
//“Dr. Malfoy,” said Dr. Potter with a hopeful look, “I was wondering if the
//__Journal of Irreproducible Results__ could consider for publication my
//paper entitled ‘On the Heritability of Magical Ability’.”

// 4309
//Draco looked at the parchment, smiling while he considered possible rejections.
//If he was a professor, he would have refused the essay as too short, so -

// 4310
//“It’s too long, Dr. Potter,” said Dr. Malfoy.

// 4311
//For a moment there was genuine incredulity on Dr. Potter’s face.

// 4312
//“Ah…” said Dr. Potter. “How about if I get rid of the separate lines for
//observations and conclusions, and just put in a __therefore__ -”

// 4313
//“Then it’ll be too short. Next!”

// 4314
//Dr. Potter trudged off.

// 4315
//“All right,” said Harry Potter, “you’re getting __too__ good at this. Two
//more times to practice, and then third time is for real, no interruptions
//between, I’ll just come in straight at you and that time you’ll reject the
//paper based on the actual content, remember, your scientific rivals are
//watching.”

// 4316
//Dr. Potter’s next paper was perfect in every way, a marvel of its kind, but
//unfortunately had to be rejected because Dr. Malfoy’s journal was having
//trouble with the letter E. Dr. Potter offered to rewrite it without those
//words, and Dr. Malfoy explained that it was really more of a vowel problem.

// 4317
//The paper after that was rejected because it was Tuesday.

// 4318
//It was, in fact, Saturday.

// 4319
//Dr. Potter tried to point this out and was told “Next!”

// 4320
//(Draco was starting to understand why Snape had used his hold over Dumbledore
//just to get a position that let him be awful to students.)

// 4321
//And then -

// 4322
//Dr. Potter was approaching with a superior smirk on his face.

// 4323
//“This is my latest paper, __On the Heritability of Magical Ability,__” Dr.
//Potter stated confidently, and thrust out the parchment. “I have decided to
//allow your journal to publish it, and have prepared it in perfect accordance
//with your guidelines so that you may publish it quickly.”

// 4324
//The Death Eater decided to track down and kill Dr. Potter after his mission was
//done. Dr. Malfoy kept a polite smile on his face, since his rivals were
//watching, and said…

// 4325
//(The pause stretched, with Dr. Potter looking at him impatiently.)

// 4326
//…”Let me look at that, please.”

// 4327
//Dr. Malfoy took the parchment and perused it carefully.

// 4328
//The Death Eater was starting to get nervous about the fact that he wasn’t a
//real scientist, and Draco was trying to remember how to talk like Harry Potter.

// 4329
//“You, ah, need to consider other possible explanations for your, um,
//observation, besides just this one -”

// 4330
//“Really?” interrupted Dr. Potter. “Like what, exactly? __House elves are
//stealing our magic?__ My data admit of only one possible conclusion, Dr. Malfoy.
//There __are__ no other plausible hypotheses.”

// 4331
//Draco was trying furiously to order his brain to think, what would he say if he
//was posing as a member of Dumbledore’s faction, what __did__ they claim
//was the explanation for wizardkind’s decline, Draco had never bothered to
//actually ask that…

// 4332
//“If you can’t think of any other way to explain my data, you’ll have to publish
//my paper, __Dr. Malfoy.__”

// 4333
//It was the sneer on Dr. Potter’s face that did it.

// 4334
//“Oh yeah?” snapped Dr. Malfoy. “How do you know that magic itself isn’t fading
//away?”

// 4335
//Time stopped.

// 4336
//Draco and Harry Potter exchanged looks of appalled horror.

// 4337
//Then Harry Potter spat something that was probably an extremely bad word if
//you’d been raised by Muggles. “__I didn’t think of that!__” said Harry
//Potter. “And I should have. The magic goes away. __Damn, damn, damn!__”

// 4338
//The alarm in Harry Potter’s voice was contagious. Without even thinking about
//it, Draco’s hand went into his robes and clutched at his wand. He’d thought the
//House of Malfoy was __safe,__ so long as you only married into families
//that could trace their bloodlines back four generations you were supposed to be
//__safe,__ it had never occurred to him before that there might be nothing
//anyone could do to stop the end of magic. “Harry, what do we do?” Draco’s voice
//was rising in panic. “__What do we do?__”

// 4339
//“__Let me think!__”

// 4340
//After a few moments, Harry grabbed from a nearby desk the same quill and roll
//of parchment he’d used to write his pretend paper, and started scribbling
//something.

// 4341
//“We’ll figure it out,” Harry said, his voice tight, “if magic is fading out of
//the world we’ll figure out how fast it’s fading and how much time we have left
//to do something, and then we’ll figure out why it’s fading, and then we’ll do
//something about it. Draco, have wizarding powers been declining at a steady
//rate, or have there been sudden drops?”

// 4342
//“I… I don’t know…”

// 4343
//“You told me that no one had matched the four founders of Hogwarts. So it’s
//been going on for at least eight centuries, then? You can’t remember hearing
//anything about the problems suddenly appearing five centuries ago or anything
//like that?”

// 4344
//Draco was trying frantically to think. “I always heard that nobody was as good
//as Merlin and then after that nobody was as good as the Founders of Hogwarts.”

// 4345
//“All right,” Harry said. He was still scribbling. “Because three centuries ago
//is when Muggles started to not believe in magic, which I thought might have
//something to do with it. And about a century and a half ago was when Muggles
//began using a kind of technology that stops working around magic and I was
//wondering if it might also go the other way around.”

// 4346
//Draco exploded out of his chair, so angry he could hardly even speak. “It’s the
//__Muggles__ -”

// 4347
//“__Damn it!__” roared Harry. “Weren’t you even listening to
//__yourself?__ It’s been going on for eight centuries at least and the
//Muggles weren’t doing anything interesting then! __We have to figure out
//the real truth!__ The Muggles __might__ have something to do with this but
//if they __don’t__ and you go blaming everything on them and that stops us
//from figuring out what’s __really__ going on then one day you’re going to
//wake up in the morning and find out that your wand is just a stick of wood!”

// 4348
//Draco’s breath stopped in his throat. His father often said __our wands
//will break in our hands__ in his speeches but Draco had never really thought
//before about what that __meant__, it wasn’t going to happen to
//__him__ after all. And now suddenly it seemed very real. __Just a
//stick of wood.__ Draco could imagine just what it would be like to take out his
//wand and try to cast a spell and find that nothing was happening…

// 4349
//That could happen to __everyone__.

// 4350
//There would be no more wizards, no more magic, ever. Just Muggles who had a few
//legends about what their ancestors had been able to do. Some of the Muggles
//would be called Malfoy, and that would be all that was left of the name.

// 4351
//For the first time in his life, Draco realized why there were Death Eaters.

// 4352
//He’d always taken for granted that becoming a Death Eater was something you did
//when you grew up. Now Draco __understood__, he knew why Father and
//Father’s friends had sworn to give their lives to prevent the nightmare from
//coming to pass, there were things you couldn’t just stand by and watch happen.
//But what if it was going to happen __anyway__, what if all the sacrifices,
//all the friends they’d lost to Dumbledore, the __family__ they’d lost,
//what if it had all been for __nothing…__

// 4353
//“Magic __can’t__ be fading away,” Draco said. His voice was breaking. “It
//wouldn’t be __fair__.”

// 4354
//Harry stopped scribbling and looked up. His face had an angry expression. “Your
//father never told you that life isn’t fair?”

// 4355
//Father had said that every single time Draco used the word. “But, but, it’s too
//awful to believe that -”

// 4356
//“Draco, let me introduce you to something I call the Litany of Tarski. It
//changes every time you use it. On this occasion it runs like so: __If
//magic is fading out of the world, I want to believe that magic is fading out of
//the world. If magic is not fading out of the world, I want not to believe that
//magic is fading out of the world. Let me not become attached to beliefs I may
//not want.__ If we’re living in a world where magic is fading, __that’s
//what we have to believe,__ we have to know what’s coming, so we can stop it, or
//in the very worst case, be prepared to do what we can in the time we have left.
//Not believing it won’t stop it from happening. So the __only__ question we
//have to ask is whether magic is __actually__ fading, and if that’s the
//world we live in then that’s what we want to believe. Litany of Gendlin:
//__What’s true is already so, owning up to it doesn’t make it worse.__ Got
//that, Draco? I’m going to make you memorize it later. It’s something you repeat
//to yourself any time you start wondering if it’s a good idea to believe
//something that isn’t actually true. In fact I want you to say it right now.
//__What’s true is already so, owning up to it doesn’t make it worse.__ Say
//it.”

// 4357
//“What’s true is already so,” repeated Draco, his voice trembling, “owning up to
//it doesn’t make it worse.”

// 4358
//“If magic is fading, I want to believe that magic is fading. If magic is not
//fading, I want not to believe that magic is fading. Say it.”

// 4359
//Draco repeated back the words, the sickness churning in his stomach.

// 4360
//“Good,” Harry said, “remember, it might __not__ be happening, and then you
//won’t have to believe it, either. __First__ we just want to know what’s
//actually going on, which world we actually live in.” Harry turned back to his
//work, scribbled some more, and then turned the parchment so Draco could see it.
//Draco leaned over the desk and Harry brought the green light closer.

// 4361
//__Observation:__

// 4362
//__Wizardry isn’t as powerful now as it was when Hogwarts was founded.__

// 4363
//__Hypotheses:__

// 4364
//__1. Magic itself is fading.__

// 4365
//__2. Wizards are interbreeding with Muggles and Squibs.__

// 4366
//__3. Knowledge to cast powerful spells is being lost.______

// 4367
//__4. Wizards are eating the wrong foods as children, or something else
//besides blood is making them grow up weaker.__

// 4368
//__5. Muggle technology is interfering with magic. (Since 800 years ago?)__

// 4369
//__6. Stronger wizards are having fewer children. (Draco = only child?
//Check if 3 powerful wizards, Quirrell / Dumbledore / Dark Lord, had any
//children.)__

// 4370
//__Tests:__

// 4371
//“All right,” Harry said. His breathing sounded a little calmer. “Now when
//you’re dealing with a confusing problem and you have no idea what’s going on,
//the smart thing to do is figure out some really simple tests, things you can
//look at right away. We need fast tests that distinguish between these
//hypotheses. Observations that would come out a different way for at least one
//of them compared to all the other ones.”

// 4372
//Draco stared at the list in shock. He was suddenly realizing that he knew an
//awful lot of purebloods who were only children. Himself, Vincent, Gregory,
//practically __everyone.__ The two most powerful wizards everyone talked
//about were Dumbledore and the Dark Lord and neither had any children just like
//Harry had suspected…

// 4373
//“It’s going to be really hard to distinguish between 2 and 6,” Harry said,
//“it’s in the blood either way, you’d have to try and track the decline of
//wizardry and compare that to how many kids different wizards were having and
//measure the abilities of Muggleborns compared to purebloods…” Harry’s fingers
//were tapping nervously on the desk. “Let’s just lump 6 in with 2 and call them
//the blood hypothesis for now. 4 is unlikely because then everyone would notice
//a sudden drop when the wizards switched to new foods, it’s hard to see what
//would’ve changed steadily over 800 years. 5 is unlikely for the same reason, no
//sudden drop, Muggles weren’t doing anything 800 years back. 4 looks like 2 and
//5 looks like 1 anyway. So mainly we should be trying to distinguish between 1,
//2, and 3.” Harry turned the parchment to himself, drew an ellipse around those
//three numbers, turned it back. “Magic is fading, blood is weakening, knowledge
//is disappearing. What test comes out differently depending on which of those is
//true? What could we see that would mean any one of these was false?”

// 4374
//“__I__ don’t know!” blurted Draco. “Why are you asking me? You’re the
//scientist!”

// 4375
//“Draco,” Harry said, a note of pleading desperation in his voice, “I only know
//what Muggle scientists know! You grew up in the wizarding world, I didn’t! You
//know more magic than I do and you know more __about__ magic than I do and
//you thought of this whole idea in the first place, so start thinking like a
//scientist and solve this!”

// 4376
//Draco swallowed hard and stared at the paper.

// 4377
//Magic is fading… wizards are interbreeding with Muggles… knowledge is being
//lost…

// 4378
//“What does the world look like if magic is fading?” said Harry Potter. “You
//know more about magic, you should be the one guessing not me! Imagine you’re
//telling a story about it, what happens in the story?”

// 4379
//Draco imagined it. “Charms that used to work stop working.” __Wizards
//wake up and find that their wands are sticks of wood…__

// 4380
//“What does the world look like if the wizarding blood gets weaker?”

// 4381
//“People can’t do things their ancestors could do.”

// 4382
//“What does the world look like if knowledge is being lost?”

// 4383
//“People don’t know how to cast the Charms in the first place…” said Draco. He
//stopped, surprised at himself. “That’s a test, isn’t it?”

// 4384
//Harry nodded decisively. “That’s one.” He wrote it down on the parchment under
//__Tests:__

// 4385
//__A. Are there spells we know but can’t cast (1 or 2) or are the lost
//spells no longer known (3)?__

// 4386
//“So that distinguishes between 1 and 2 on the one hand, and 3 on the other
//hand,” said Harry. “Now we need some way to distinguish between 1 and 2. Magic
//fading, blood weakening, how could we tell the difference?”

// 4387
//“What kind of Charms did students used to cast in their first year at
//Hogwarts?” said Draco. “If they used to be able to cast much more powerful
//Charms, the blood was stronger -”

// 4388
//Harry Potter shook his head. “Or magic itself was stronger. We have to figure
//out some way of telling the __difference.__” Harry stood up from his
//chair, began pacing nervously through the classroom. “No, wait, that might
//still work. Suppose different spells use up different amounts of magical
//energy. Then if the ambient magic weakened, the powerful spells would die
//first, but the spells everyone learns in their first year would stay the same…”
//Harry’s nervous pacing sped up. “It’s not a very good test, it’s more about
//powerful wizardry being lost versus all wizardry being lost, someone’s blood
//could be too weak for powerful wizardry but strong enough for easy spells…
//Draco, do you know if more powerful wizards within a __single__ era, like
//powerful wizards from just this century, are more powerful as children? If the
//Dark Lord had cast the Cooling Charm when he was eleven, could he have frozen
//the whole room?”

// 4389
//Draco’s face screwed up as he tried to recollect. “I can’t remember hearing
//anything about the Dark Lord but I think Dumbledore’s supposed to have done
//something amazing on his Transfiguration O.W.L.s in fifth year… I think other
//powerful wizards were good in Hogwarts too…”

// 4390
//Harry scowled, still pacing. “They could just be studying hard. Still, if
//first-year students learned the same spells and seemed about as powerful then
//as now, we could call that __weak__ evidence favoring 1 over 2… wait, hold
//on.” Harry stopped where he stood. “I have another test that might distinguish
//between 1 and 2. It would take a while to explain, it uses some things that
//scientists know about blood and inheritance, but it’s an easy question to ask.
//And if we __combine__ my test and your test and they both come out the
//same way, that’s a strong hint at the answer.” Harry almost ran back to the
//desk, took the parchment and wrote:

// 4391
//__B. Did ancient first-year students cast the same sort of spells, with
//the same power, as now? (Weak evidence for 1 over 2, but blood could also be
//losing powerful wizardry only.)__

// 4392
//__C. Additional test that distinguishes 1 and 2 using scientific
//knowledge of blood, will explain later.__

// 4393
//“Okay,” said Harry, “we can at least try to tell the difference between 1 and 2
//and 3, so let’s go with this right away, we can figure out __more__ tests
//after we do the ones we already have. Now it’s going to look a little odd if
//Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter go around asking questions together, so here’s my
//idea. You’ll go through Hogwarts and find old portraits and ask them about what
//spells they learned to cast during their first years. They’re portraits so they
//won’t know there’s anything odd about Draco Malfoy doing that. I’ll ask recent
//portraits and living people about spells we know but can’t cast, no one will
//notice anything unusual if Harry Potter asks weird questions. And I’ll have to
//do complicated research about forgotten spells, so I want you to be the one to
//gather the data I need for my own scientific question. It’s a simple question
//and you should be able to find the answer by asking portraits. You might want
//to write this down, ready?”

// 4394
//Draco sat down again and scrabbled in his bookbag for parchment and quill. When
//it was laid down on the desk, Draco looked up, face determined. “Go ahead.”

// 4395
//“Find portraits who knew a married Squib couple - don’t make that face, Draco,
//it’s important information. Just ask recent portraits who are Gryffindors or
//something. Find portraits who knew a married Squib couple well enough to know
//the names of all their children. Write down the name of each child and whether
//that child was a wizard, a Squib, or a Muggle. If they don’t know whether the
//child was a Squib or a Muggle, write down ‘non-wizard’. Write that down for
//__every__ child the couple had, don’t leave any out. If the portrait only
//knows the name of the wizarding children, not the names of __all__ the
//children, then don’t write down __any__ data from that couple. It’s very
//important that you only bring me data from someone who knows __all__ the
//children a Squib couple had, well enough to know them all by name. Try to get
//at least forty names total, if you can, and if you have time for more, even
//better. Have you got all that?”

// 4396
//“Repeat it,” Draco said, when he was done writing, and Harry repeated it.

// 4397
//“I’ve got it,” Draco said, “but why -”

// 4398
//“It has to do with one of the secrets of blood that scientists already
//discovered. I’ll explain when you get back. Let’s split up and meet back here
//in an hour, 6:22pm that should be. Are we ready to go?”

// 4399
//Draco nodded decisively. It was all very rushed, but he’d long since been
//taught how to rush.

// 4400
//“Then __go!__” said Harry Potter and yanked off his cowled cloak and
//shoved it into his pouch, which began eating it, and, without even waiting for
//his pouch to finish, spun around and began striding rapidly toward the
//classroom door, bumping into a desk and almost falling over in his haste.

// 4401
//By the time Draco had managed to get his own cloak off and stow it in his
//bookbag, Harry Potter was gone.

// 4402
//Draco almost ran out the door.
