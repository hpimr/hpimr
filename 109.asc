//== Reflections

// 18558
//__Even the greatest artifact can be defeated by a counter-artifact that
//is lesser, but specialized.__

// 18559
//That was what the Defense Professor had told Harry, after dropping the True
//Cloak of Invisibility to pool in fuliginous folds near Harry’s shoes.

// 18560
//__The Mirror of Perfect Reflection has power over what is reflected
//within it, and that power is said to be unchallengeable. But since the True
//Cloak of Invisibility produces a perfect absence of image, it should evade this
//principle rather than challenging it.__

// 18561
//There had followed a series of questions in Parseltongue establishing that
//Harry currently did not intend to do anything stupid or try to run away, and
//further reminders that Professor Quirrell could sense him and had spells to
//detect the Cloak and was holding hostage hundreds of lives plus Hermione.

// 18562
//Then Harry was told to don the Cloak, open the door that lay beyond the
//quenched fires, and advance through the door into the final chamber; as
//Professor Quirrell stood well back, outside of that door’s sight.

// 18563
//The last chamber was illuminated in lights of soft gold, and the stone walls
//were of gentle white and faced with marble.

// 18564
//In the center of the room stood a simple and unornamented golden frame, and
//within the frame was a portal to another gold-illuminated room, beyond whose
//door which lay another Potions chamber; that was what Harry’s brain told him.
//The Mirror’s transformation of light was so perfect that conscious thought was
//required to deduce that the room inside the frame was only a reflection, rather
//than a portal. (Though it might have been easier to intuit if Harry hadn’t been
//invisible, just then.)

// 18565
//The Mirror did not touch the ground; the golden frame had no feet. It didn’t
//look like it was hovering; it looked like it was fixed in place, more solid and
//more motionless than the walls themselves, like it was nailed to the reference
//frame of the Earth’s motion.

// 18566
//“Is the Mirror there? Is it moving?” came Professor Quirrell’s commanding voice
//from the Potions Chamber.

// 18567
//“__Iss there,__” Harry hissed back. ”__Not moving.__”

// 18568
//Again tones of command rang forth. “Walk around to the back of the Mirror.”

// 18569
//From behind, the golden frame appeared solid, showing no reflections, and Harry
//said so in Parseltongue.

// 18570
//“Now take off your Cloak,” commanded Professor Quirrell’s voice still from
//within the Potions room. “Report to me at once if the Mirror moves to face
//you.”

// 18571
//Harry took off his Cloak.

// 18572
//The Mirror remained nailed to the reference frame of Earth’s motion; and Harry
//reported this.

// 18573
//Shortly after there came a hissing and seething, and a balefire phoenix melted
//through the marble wall behind Harry, the ambient light in the room taking on a
//red tinge as it entered. Professor Quirrell followed behind it, walking out of
//the new-made corridor that had been carved, his black formal shoes unharmed by
//the red-glowing molten surface beneath. “Well,” Professor Quirrell said, “that
//is one possible trap averted. And now…” Professor Quirrell exhaled. “Now we
//will think of possible strategies for retrieving the Stone from the Mirror, and
//you will try them; for I prefer not to let my own image be reflected. I give
//you fair warning, this is the part that may prove tedious.”

// 18574
//“I take it this isn’t a problem you can solve with Fiendfyre?”

// 18575
//“Ha,” said Professor Quirrell, and gestured.

// 18576
//The balefire phoenix moved forward in a rush of crimson terror, the red light
//casting writhing shadows on the remaining marble walls. Harry jumped back
//before he could think.

// 18577
//The dreadful dark-red blaze rushed past Professor Quirrell, surged into the
//golden back of the Mirror, and disappeared as fast as it touched the gold.

// 18578
//Then the fire was gone, and the room was tinged scarlet no more.

// 18579
//There was no scratch upon the golden surface, no glow to mark the absorption of
//heat. The Mirror had simply remained in place, untouched.

// 18580
//Chills went down Harry’s spine. If he’d been playing Dungeons and Dragons and
//the dungeon master had reported that result, Harry would have suspected a
//mental illusion, and rolled to disbelieve.

// 18581
//Upon the center of the golden back had appeared a sequence of runes in no known
//alphabet, black absences of light in small lines and curves, arranged in a
//level horizontal row. The thought occurred to Harry that some minor concealing
//illusion had been consumed in the Fiendfyre, a far lesser enchantment that had
//been added to prevent children from seeing those letters…

// 18582
//“How old is this Mirror?” Harry said in almost a whisper.

// 18583
//“Nobody knows, Mr. Potter.” The Defense Professor reached out his fingers
//toward the runes, a look of something like reverence on his face; but his
//fingers did not touch the gold. “But my guess is the same as yours, I think. It
//is said, in certain legends that may or may not be fabrications, that this
//Mirror reflects __itself__ perfectly and therefore its existence is
//absolutely stable. So stable that the Mirror was able to survive when every
//other effect of Atlantis was undone, all its consequences severed from Time.
//You can see why I was amused when you suggested Fiendfyre.” The Defense
//Professor let his hand fall.

// 18584
//Even in the middle of everything else, Harry felt the awe, if that was true.
//The golden frame gleamed no brighter than before, for all the revelation; but
//you could imagine it going back, and back, into a civilization that had been
//made to never be… “What - does the Mirror __do,__ exactly?”

// 18585
//“An excellent question,” said Professor Quirrell. “The answer is in the runes
//that are written upon the Mirror’s golden frame. Read them to me.”

// 18586
//“They’re not in any alphabet I recognize. They look like randomly oriented
//chicken-scratches drawn by Tolkien elves.”

// 18587
//“Read them anyway. __Iss not dangerouss.__”

// 18588
//“The runes say, __noitilov detalo partxe tnere hoc ruoy tu becafruoy ton
//wo hsi -__” Harry stopped, feeling more prickles at his spine.

// 18589
//Harry knew what the rune for noitilov __meant__. It meant noitilov. And
//the next runes said to detalo the noitilov until it reached partxe, then keep
//the part that was both tnere and hoc. That belief felt like knowledge, like he
//could have answered ‘Yes’ with confident authority if somebody asked him
//whether the ton wo was ruoy or becafruoy. It was just that when Harry tried to
//relate those concepts to any other concepts, he drew a blank.

// 18590
//__“Do you undersstand what wordss mean, boy?”__

// 18591
//__“Don’t think sso.”__

// 18592
//Professor Quirrell gave a soft exhalation, his eyes not leaving the golden
//frame. “I had wondered if perhaps the Words of False Comprehension might be
//understandable to a student of Muggle science. Apparently not.”

// 18593
//“Maybe -” Harry began.

// 18594
//__Really, Ravenclaw?__ said Slytherin. __You’re pulling this
//____NOW?__

// 18595
//“Maybe I could try again to understand the words if I knew more about the
//Mirror?” said Harry’s Ravenclaw part, which had assumed direct control.

// 18596
//Professor Quirrell’s lips quirked up. “As with most ancient things, scholars
//have written down enough lies that it is hard to be sure of anything by now. It
//is definite that the Mirror is at least as old as Merlin, for it is known that
//Merlin used it as a tool. It is also known that after his death, Merlin left
//written instructions that the Mirror did not need to be sealed away, despite it
//having certain powers that might normally cause one to worry. He wrote that,
//given how painstakingly the Mirror had been crafted to not destroy the world,
//it would be easier to destroy the world using a lump of cheese.”

// 18597
//This statement struck Harry as not entirely reassuring.

// 18598
//“Certain other facts about the Mirror are attested by famous wizards who were
//reasonably skeptical, and whose word has otherwise proven reliable. The
//Mirror’s most characteristic power is to create alternate realms of existence,
//though these realms are only as large in size as what can be seen within the
//Mirror; it is known that people and other objects can be stored therein. It is
//claimed by several authorities that the Mirror alone of all magics possesses a
//true moral orientation, though I am not sure what that could mean in practical
//terms. I would expect moralists to call the Cruciatus Curse by their name of
//‘evil’ and the Patronus Charm by their name of ‘good’; I cannot guess what a
//moralist would think was any __more__ moral than that. But it is claimed,
//for example, that phoenixes came into our world from a realm that was evoked
//inside this Mirror.”

// 18599
//Words like __Jeepers__ and what his parents would have termed
//inappropriate language were all running through Harry’s head, none very
//coherently, as he stared at the golden back of the Mirror.

// 18600
//“I have wandered the world and encountered many stories that are not often
//heard,” said Professor Quirrell. “Most of them seemed to me to be lies, but a
//few had the ring of history rather than storytelling. Upon a wall of metal in a
//place where no one had come for centuries, I found written the claim that some
//Atlanteans foresaw their world’s end, and sought to forge a device of great
//power to avert the inevitable catastrophe. If that device had been completed,
//the story claimed, it would have become an absolutely stable existence that
//could withstand the channeling of unlimited magic in order to grant wishes. And
//also - this was said to be the vastly harder task - the device would somehow
//avert the inevitable catastrophes any sane person would expect to follow from
//that premise. The aspect I found interesting was that, according to the tale
//writ upon those metal plates, the rest of Atlantis ignored this project and
//went upon their ways. It was sometimes praised as a noble public endeavor, but
//nearly all other Atlanteans found more important things to do on any given day
//than help. Even the Atlantean nobles ignored the prospect of somebody other
//than themselves obtaining unchallengeable power, which a less experienced cynic
//might expect to catch their attention. With relatively little support, the tiny
//handful of would-be makers of this device labored under working conditions that
//were not so much dramatically arduous, as pointlessly annoying. Eventually time
//ran out and Atlantis was destroyed with the device still far from complete. I
//recognise certain echoes of my own experience that one does not usually see
//invented in mere tales.” A twist in the dry smile. “But perhaps that is merely
//my own preference for one tale among a hundred other legends. You perceive,
//however, the echo of Merlin’s statement about the Mirror’s creators shaping it
//to not destroy the world. Most importantly for our purposes, it may explain why
//the Mirror would have the previously unknown capability that Dumbledore or
//Perenelle seems to have evoked, of showing any person who steps before it an
//illusion of a world in which one of their desires has been fulfilled. It is the
//sort of sensible precaution you can imagine someone building into a
//wish-granting creation meant to not go horribly wrong.”

// 18601
//“Wow,” Harry whispered, and meant it. This was Magic with a capital M, the sort
//of Magic that appeared in __So You Want To Be A Wizard,__ not just a
//collection of random physics-violating things you could do with a wand.

// 18602
//Professor Quirrell gestured at the golden back. “The final property upon which
//most tales agree, is that whatever the unknown means of commanding the Mirror -
//of that Key there are no plausible accounts - the Mirror’s instructions cannot
//be shaped to react to individual people. So it is not possible for Perenelle to
//command this Mirror, ‘only give the Stone to Perenelle’. Dumbledore cannot
//state, ‘Only give the Stone to one who wishes to give it to Nicholas Flamel’.
//There is in the Mirror a blindness such as philosophers have attributed to
//ideal justice; it must treat all who come before it by the same rule, whatever
//rule may be in force. Thus, there must be some rule for reaching the Stone’s
//hiding-place which anyone can invoke. And now you see why __you__, called
//the Boy-Who-Lived, shall implement whatever strategies the two of us devise.
//For it was said that this thing possesses a moral orientation, and it may have
//been given commands reflecting the same. I am well aware that on conventional
//terms you are said to be Good, just as I am said to be Evil.” Professor
//Quirrell smiled, rather darkly. “So as our first attempt - though not our last,
//rest assured-let us see what this Mirror makes of your attempt to retrieve the
//Stone in order to save the life of Hermione Granger and hundreds of your fellow
//students.”

// 18603
//“And the __first__ version of that plan,” said Harry, who was beginning to
//finally understand, “the one you invented on Friday in my first week of
//Hogwarts, called for the Stone to be retrieved by Dumbledore’s golden child,
//the Boy-Who-Lived, making a selfless and noble attempt to save the life of his
//dying Defense teacher, Professor Quirrell.”

// 18604
//“Of course,” said Professor Quirrell.

// 18605
//It was a poetical sort of plot, Harry supposed, but his appreciation of that
//elegance was being hampered by the surrounding circumstances.

// 18606
//Then another thought occurred to Harry.

// 18607
//“Um,” Harry said. “You think that this Mirror is a trap for you -”

// 18608
//“There is no way beneath the heavens that it is not meant as a trap.”

// 18609
//“That is to say, it’s a trap for Lord Voldemort. Only it can’t be a trap for
//him personally. There has to be a general rule that underlies it, some
//generalizable quality of Lord Voldemort that triggers it.” Without conscious
//awareness, Harry was frowning hard at the Mirror’s golden back.

// 18610
//“As you say,” said Professor Quirrell, who was beginning to frown at Harry’s
//frowning.

// 18611
//“Well, on the first Thursday of this year, the mad Headmaster Dumbledore, who
//I’d just seen incinerate a chicken, told me that I had no chance whatsoever of
//getting into his forbidden corridor, since I didn’t know the spell
//__Alohomora.__”

// 18612
//“I __see,__” said Professor Quirrell. “Oh, dear. I wish you had thought to
//mention this to me a good deal earlier.”

// 18613
//Neither of them needed to state aloud the obvious, that this bit of reverse
//reverse psychology had successfully ensured that Harry would stay the heck away
//from Dumbledore’s forbidden corridor.

// 18614
//Harry was still concentrating. “Do you think Dumbledore suspects that I am, in
//his terms, a horcrux of Lord Voldemort, or more generally, that some aspects of
//my personality were copied off Lord Voldemort?” Even as Harry asked this aloud,
//he realized what a dumb question it was, and how much completely blatant
//evidence he’d already seen that -

// 18615
//“Dumbledore cannot __possibly__ have missed it,” said Professor Quirrell.
//“It is not exactly subtle. What else is Dumbledore to think, that you are an
//actor in a play whose stupid author has never met a real eleven-year-old? Only
//a gibbering dullard would believe that - ah, never mind.”

// 18616
//The two of them stared at the Mirror in silence.

// 18617
//Finally Professor Quirrell sighed. “I have outwitted myself, I fear. Neither
//you nor I dare be reflected in this Mirror. I suppose I must command Professor
//Sprout to undo my Obliviations of Mr. Nott and Miss Greengrass… You see, the
//other great difficulty of the Mirror is that the rule by which it treats those
//reflected will disregard external forces, such as False Memories or a Confundus
//Charm. The Mirror reflects only those forces arising from within the person
//themselves, the states of mind they arrive at through their own choices; so it
//is said in several places. That is why I had Mr. Nott and Miss Greengrass,
//believing different stories about why the Stone’s extraction was necessary,
//ready to appear before this Mirror.” Professor Quirrell rubbed at the bridge of
//his nose. “I constructed other stories for other students, ready for me to set
//into motion with the chosen trigger… but as this day approached, I began to
//feel pessimistic about the project. Such as Nott and Greengrass still seem
//worth trying, if we cannot think of something better. But I wonder if
//Dumbledore has tried to construct this puzzle to specifically resist
//Voldemort’s cunning. I wonder if he might have succeeded. If you devise an
//alternative plan which I approve enough to try, __I promisse that
//whatever pawn I ssend forth sshall not be harmed by me, then or ever; nor do I
//expect to break that promisse__. And I remind you again of the hostages I hold
//to my failure, both Miss Granger and all the others.”

// 18618
//Again they stared at the mirror in silence, the elder Tom Riddle and the
//younger.

// 18619
//“I suspect, Professor,” Harry said after a time, “that your entire class of
//hypotheses about somebody needing to want the Stone for good or honest purposes
//is mistaken. The Headmaster wouldn’t set a retrieval rule like that.”

// 18620
//“Why?”

// 18621
//“Because Dumbledore knows how easy it is to end up believing that you’re doing
//the right thing when you’re actually not. It’d be the first possibility he
//imagined.”

// 18622
//“__Iss it truth or trickery that I hear?__”

// 18623
//“__Am being honesst,__” Harry said.

// 18624
//Professor Quirrell nodded. “Then your point is well taken.”

// 18625
//“I’m not sure why you think this puzzle is solvable,” Harry said. “Just set a
//rule like, your left hand must hold a small blue pyramid and two large red
//pyramids, and your right hand must be squeezing mayonnaise onto a hamster -”

// 18626
//“No,” Professor Quirrell said. “No, I think not. The legends are unclear on
//what rules can be given, but I think it must have something to do with the
//Mirror’s original intended use - it must have something to do with the deep
//desires and wishes arising from within the person. Squeezing mayonnaise onto a
//hamster will not qualify as that, for most people.”

// 18627
//“Huh,” Harry said. “Maybe the rule is that the person has to not want to use
//the Stone at all - no, that’s too easy, the story you gave Mr. Nott solves it.”

// 18628
//“In some ways you may understand Dumbledore better than I,” said Professor
//Quirrell. “So now I ask you this: how would Dumbledore use his notion of the
//acceptance of death to guard this Stone? For that above all he thinks I cannot
//comprehend, and he is not far wrong.”

// 18629
//Harry thought about this for a while, considering several ideas and discarding
//them. And then, having thought of something, Harry considered remaining silent…
//before mapping out the obvious part of the future conversation where Professor
//Quirrell asked him to say in Parseltongue if he’d thought of something.

// 18630
//Reluctantly, Harry spoke. “Would Dumbledore think that this Mirror could reach
//the afterlife? Could he put the Stone into something that he __thinks__ is
//an afterlife, so that only people who believe in an afterlife can see it?”

// 18631
//“Hm…” Professor Quirrell said. “Possibly… yes, there is a certain plausibility
//to it. Using this setting of the Mirror to show people their heart’s desires…
//Albus Dumbledore would see himself reunited with his family. He would see
//himself united with them __in death,__ wanting to die himself rather than
//wishing for them to be returned to life. His brother Aberforth, his sister
//Ariana, his parents Kendra and Percival… it would be Aberforth to whom
//Dumbledore gave the Stone, I think. Would the Mirror recognize that Aberforth
//particularly had been given the Stone? Or will any person’s dead relative do,
//if that person believes their relative’s spirit would give them back the
//Stone?” Professor Quirrell was pacing in a short circle, keeping well away from
//Harry and the Mirror as he moved. “But all this is only one idea. Let us devise
//another.”

// 18632
//Harry began to tap his cheek, then stopped abruptly as he realized where he’d
//picked up that gesture. “What if Perenelle is the one who put the Stone in
//here? Maybe she keyed the Mirror to give the Stone only to the person who put
//it in originally.”

// 18633
//“Perenelle has lived this long by knowing her limitations,” said Professor
//Quirrell. “She does not overestimate her own intellect, she is not prideful, if
//that were so she would have lost the Stone long ago. Perenelle will not try to
//think of a good Mirror-rule herself, not when Master Flamel can leave the
//matter in Dumbledore’s wiser hands… but the rule of only returning the Stone to
//the one who remembers placing it, also works if Dumbledore himself has placed
//the Stone. It would be a hard rule to bypass, since I cannot simply Confund
//someone into believing that they put in the Stone… I would have to create a
//false Stone, and a false Mirror, and arrange the drama…” Professor Quirrell was
//frowning, now. “But it is still something that Dumbledore would imagine
//Voldemort being able to arrange, given time. If at all possible, Dumbledore
//will want to make the key to the Mirror a state of mind he thinks I
//__cannot__ arrange in a pawn - or a rule that Dumbledore thinks Voldemort
//can never comprehend, such as a rule involving the acceptance of one’s own
//death. That is why I considered your previous idea plausible.”

// 18634
//Then Harry had an idea.

// 18635
//He was not sure if it was a good idea.

// 18636
//…it wasn’t like Harry had a lot of choice here.

// 18637
//“Arguendo,” Harry said. “We’re not sure what’s necessary to retrieve the Stone.
//But a __sufficient__ condition should involve Albus Dumbledore, or maybe
//someone else, in a state of mind where they believe that the Dark Lord has been
//defeated, that the threat is over, and that it is time to take out the Stone
//and give it back to Nicholas Flamel. We aren’t sure which part of that person’s
//state of mind, let’s say Dumbledore’s, will be the necessary part that he
//thinks Lord Voldemort can’t understand or duplicate; but under those conditions
//Dumbledore’s entire state of mind will be __sufficient.__”

// 18638
//“Reasonable,” said Professor Quirrell. “So?”

// 18639
//“The corresponding strategy,” Harry said carefully, “is to mimic Dumbledore’s
//state of mind under those conditions, in as much detail as possible, while
//standing in front of the mirror. And this state of mind must have been produced
//by internal forces, not external ones.”

// 18640
//“But how are we to get that without Legilimency or the Confundus Charm, both of
//which would certainly be external - ha. I __see.__” Professor Quirrell’s
//ice-pale eyes were suddenly piercing. “You suggest that I Confund
//__myself,__ as you cast that hex upon yourself during your first day in
//Battle Magic. So that it is an internal force and not an external one, a state
//of mind that comes about through only my own choices. Say to me whether you
//have made this suggestion with the intention of trapping me, boy. Say it to me
//in Parseltongue.”

// 18641
//“__My mind that you assked to devisse sstrategy may perhapss have been
//influenced by ssuch an intent - who knowss? Knew you would be ssusspiciouss,
//assk thiss very question. Decission is up to you, teacher. I know nothing you
//do not know, about whether thiss iss likely to trap you. Do not call it
//betrayal by me if you choosse thiss for yoursself, and it failss.__” Harry felt
//a strong impulse to smile, and suppressed it.

// 18642
//“Lovely,” said Professor Quirrell, who __was__ smiling. “I suppose there
//are some threats from an inventive mind that even questioning in Parseltongue
//cannot neutralize.”

// 18643
//Harry put on the Cloak of Invisibility, at Professor Quirrell’s orders, to
//__sstop the man who sshall believe himsself to be sschoolmasster from
//sseeing you,__ as Professor Quirrell said in Parseltongue.

// 18644
//“Wearing the Cloak or no, you will stand in range of the Mirror yourself,”
//Professor Quirrell said. “If a gush of lava comes forth, you will also burn. I
//feel that much symmetry should apply.”

// 18645
//Professor Quirrell pointed to a spot near the right of the door through which
//they’d entered the room, before the Mirror and well back of it. Harry, wearing
//the Cloak, went to where Professor Quirrell had pointed him, and did not argue.
//It was increasingly unclear to Harry whether both Riddles dying here would be a
//bad thing, even with hundreds of other student hostages at stake. For all of
//Harry’s good intentions, he’d mostly shown himself so far to be an idiot, and
//the returned Lord Voldemort was a threat to the entire world.

// 18646
//(Though either way, Harry couldn’t see Dumbledore doing the lava thing.
//Dumbledore was probably sufficiently angry at Voldemort to discard his usual
//restraint, but lava wouldn’t permanently stop an entity that Dumbledore
//believed to be a discorporate soul.)

// 18647
//Then Professor Quirrell pointed with his wand, and a shimmering circle appeared
//around where Harry was standing on the floor. This, Professor Quirrell said,
//would soon become a Greater Circle of Concealment, by which nothing within that
//circle could be heard or seen from the outside. Harry would not be able to make
//himself apparent to the false Dumbledore by taking off the Cloak, nor by
//shouting.

// 18648
//“You __will not__ cross this circle once it is active,” Professor Quirrell
//said. “That would cause you to touch my magic, and while Confunded I might not
//remember how to halt the resonance that would destroy us both. And further,
//since I do not want you throwing shoes -” Professor Quirrell made another
//gesture, and just within the Greater Circle of Concealment, a slight shimmer
//appeared in the air, a globe-shaped distortion. “__Thiss barrier will
//explode if touched, by you or other material thing.__ The resonance might lash
//at me afterward, but you would also be dead. Now tell me in Parseltongue that
//you do not intend to cross this circle or take off your Cloak or do
//__anything __at all impulsive or stupid. Tell you me you will wait quietly
//here, under the Cloak, until this is over.”

// 18649
//This Harry repeated back.

// 18650
//Then Professor Quirrell’s robes became black tinged with gold, such robes as
//Dumbledore might wear upon a formal occasion; and Professor Quirrell pointed
//his own wand at his head.

// 18651
//Professor Quirrell stayed motionless for a long time, still holding his wand to
//his head. His eyes were closed in concentration.

// 18652
//And then Professor Quirrell said, “__Confundus.__”

// 18653
//At once the expression of the man standing there changed; he blinked a few
//times as though confused, lowering his wand.

// 18654
//A deep weariness spread over the face Professor Quirrell had worn; without any
//visible change his eyes seemed older, the few lines in his face calling
//attention to themselves.

// 18655
//His lips were set in a sad smile.

// 18656
//Without any hurry, the man quietly walked over to the Mirror, as though he had
//all the time in the world.

// 18657
//He crossed into the Mirror’s range of reflection without anything happening,
//and stared into the surface.

// 18658
//What the man might be seeing there, Harry could not tell; to Harry it seemed
//that the flat, perfect surface still reflected the room behind it, like a
//portal to another place.

// 18659
//“Ariana,” breathed the man. “Mother, father. And you, my brother, it is done.”

// 18660
//The man stood still, as if listening.

// 18661
//“Yes, done,” the man said. “Voldemort came before this mirror, and was trapped
//by Merlin’s method. He is only one more sealed horror now.”

// 18662
//Again the listening stillness.

// 18663
//“I would that I could obey you, my brother, but it is better this way.” The man
//bowed his head. “He is denied his death, forever; that vengeance is terrible
//enough.”

// 18664
//Harry felt a twinge, watching this, a sense that this was __not__ what
//Dumbledore would have said, it seemed more like a strawman, a shallow
//stereotype… but then this wasn’t the real Aberforth’s spirit either, this was
//who Professor Quirrell imagined Dumbledore imagined Aberforth was, and that
//doubly-reflected image of Aberforth wouldn’t notice anything amiss…

// 18665
//“It is time to give back the Philosopher’s Stone,” said the man who thought he
//was Dumbledore. “It must go back into Master Flamel’s keeping, now.”

// 18666
//Listening stillness.

// 18667
//“No,” said the man, “Master Flamel has kept it safe these many years from all
//who would seek immortality, and I think it will be safest in his hands… no,
//Aberforth, I do think his intentions are good.”

// 18668
//Harry couldn’t control the tension that was running through him like a live
//wire; he was having trouble breathing. Imperfect, Professor Quirrell’s
//Confundus Charm had been imperfect. The underlying personality of Professor
//Quirrell was leaking through and seeing the obvious question, why it was okay
//for Nicholas Flamel himself to have the Stone if immortality was so awful. Even
//if Professor Quirrell conceptualized Dumbledore as being blind to the question,
//Professor Quirrell hadn’t included a clause in the Confundus saying that
//__Dumbledore’s image of Aberforth__ wouldn’t think of it; and all of this
//was ultimately a reflection of Professor Quirrell’s own mind, an image from
//within the intelligence of Tom Riddle…

// 18669
//“Destroy it?” said the man. “Maybe. I am not sure it __can__ be destroyed,
//or Master Flamel would have done it long since. I think, many times, that he
//has regretted making it… Aberforth, I promised him, and we are not so ancient
//or so wise ourselves. The Philosopher’s Stone must go back into the keeping of
//the one who made it.”

// 18670
//And Harry’s breath stopped.

// 18671
//The man was holding an irregular chunk of scarlet glass in his left hand, the
//size perhaps of Harry’s thumb from fingernail to the first joint. The sheened
//surface of the scarlet glass made it seem wet; the appearance was of blood,
//suspended in time and made into a jagged surface.

// 18672
//“Thank you, my brother,” the man said quietly.

// 18673
//__Is that what the Stone should look like? Does Professor Quirrell know
//what the true Stone should look like? Will the Mirror give back the real Stone
//under these conditions, or make an imitation and return that?__

// 18674
//And then -

// 18675
//“No, Ariana,” the man said, smiling gently, “I fear I must go now. Be patient,
//my dearest, it will be soon enough that I join you in truth… why? Why, I am not
//sure why I must go… when I hold the Stone I am to step aside from the Mirror
//and wait for Master Flamel to contact me, but I am not sure why I need to step
//aside from the Mirror to do that…” The man sighed. “Ah, I am getting old. It is
//well this dreadful war ended when it did. I suppose there is no harm if I speak
//to you for a time, my dearest, if you wish it so.”

// 18676
//A headache was starting behind Harry’s eyes; some part of Harry was trying to
//send a message about not having breathed in a while, but no one was listening.
//__ Imperfect__, Professor Quirrell’s Confundus Charm had been imperfect,
//Professor Quirrell’s image of Dumbledore’s image of Ariana wanted to talk to
//Dumbledore, and maybe didn’t want to wait because Professor Quirrell knew on
//some level that there wasn’t really an afterlife, and the previously implanted
//impulse to leave after getting the Stone __wasn’t standing up to
//Riddle-Ariana’s arguments…__

// 18677
//And then Harry felt himself become very calm. He started breathing again.

// 18678
//Either way, there wasn’t much Harry could do about it. Professor Quirrell had
//stopped Harry from intervening; well, Professor Quirrell was welcome to reap
//the consequences of that decision. If the consequences caught Harry as well, so
//be it.

// 18679
//The man who thought he was Dumbledore was mostly nodding patiently, sometimes
//replying to his dearest sister. Sometimes the man cast an uneasy look to one
//side; as if feeling a strong impulse to go, but suppressing that impulse with
//the great patience and politeness and concern for his sister that Professor
//Quirrell imagined Albus Dumbledore having.

// 18680
//Harry saw it the instant the Confundus wore off, and the man’s expression
//changed, becoming again the face of Professor Quirrell.

// 18681
//And in the same instant the Mirror changed, no longer showing Harry the
//reflection of the room, showing instead the form of the real Albus Dumbledore,
//as though he were standing just behind the Mirror and visible through it.

// 18682
//The real Dumbledore’s face was set, and grim.

// 18683
//“Hello, Tom,” said Albus Dumbledore.
