//== Coordination Problems, Pt 2

// 6895
//Minerva and Dumbledore together had applied their combined talent to conjure
//the grand stage toward which Quirrell now slowly trudged; it was, at its core,
//sturdy wood, but the outer surfaces shone with glitter of marble inlaid with
//platinum and studded with gems of every House color. Neither she nor the
//Headmaster was any Founder of Hogwarts, but the conjuration only needed to last
//a few hours. Minerva ordinarily enjoyed the few occasions when she had the
//occasion to tire herself out on large Transfigurations; she should have enjoyed
//the many small chances for artistry, and the illusion of opulence; but this
//time she had done the work with the dreadful feeling of digging her own grave.

// 6896
//But Minerva was feeling a little better now. There’d been one brief moment when
//the explosion might’ve come; but Dumbledore had already been standing up and
//applauding warmly, and no one had proven foolish enough to riot in front of the
//Headmaster.

// 6897
//And the explosive mood had rapidly faded into a collective sentiment which
//might perhaps have been described by the phrase: __Give us a break!__

// 6898
//Blaise Zabini had shot himself in the name of Sunshine, and the final score had
//been 254 to 254 to 254.____

// 6899
//____

// 6900
//Behind the stage, waiting to ascend, three children were glaring at each other
//in mingled fury and frustration. It didn’t help that they were still damp from
//being fished out of the lake, and that the Warming Charms didn’t seem quite
//enough to make up for the crisp December air, or maybe it was just their mood.

// 6901
//“That’s __it__,” said Granger. “I’ve __had__ it! No more traitors!”

// 6902
//“I completely agree with you, Miss Granger,” Draco said icily. “Enough is
//enough.”

// 6903
//“And what do __you__ two intend to do about it?” snapped Harry Potter.
//“Professor Quirrell already said he wouldn’t ban spies!”

// 6904
//“We’ll ban them __for__ him,” said Draco grimly. He hadn’t even understood
//what he meant by the words as he said them, but the very act of speaking seemed
//to crystallize a plan -

// 6905
//The stage really was well done, at least for a temporary structure; the makers
//hadn’t fallen into the usual pitfall of being impressed by their own illusion
//of wealth, and knew something about architecture and visual style. From where
//Draco stood, in the obvious place for him to stand, the watching students would
//see him haloed in the faint glitter of emeralds; and Granger, standing where
//Draco had subtly motioned her, would be haloed in Ravenclaw’s sapphire. As for
//Harry Potter, Draco wasn’t looking at him right now.

// 6906
//Professor Quirrell had… awakened, or whatever it was he did; and was leaning
//upon a platinum podium bare of all gems. With evident showmanship, the Defense
//Professor was carefully stacking and squaring those three envelopes containing
//the three parchments upon which the three generals had written their wishes, as
//all the students of Hogwarts watched, and waited.

// 6907
//Finally Professor Quirrell looked up from the envelopes. “Well,” said the
//Defense Professor. “This is inconvenient.”

// 6908
//A slight titter of laughter ran through the crowd, with a sharp undertone.

// 6909
//“I suppose you are all wondering what I will do?” said Professor Quirrell.
//“There is nothing for it; I shall have to do what is fair. Although first there
//was a little speech I wanted to make, and before even that, it appears to me
//that Mr. Malfoy and Miss Granger have something they wish to share.”

// 6910
//Draco blinked, and then he and Granger traded rapid glances - __may I?__ -
//__yes, go ahead -__ and Draco raised his voice.

// 6911
//“General Granger and I would both like to say,” Draco said in his most formal
//voice, knowing it was being amplified and heard, “that we will no longer accept
//the help of any traitors. And if, in any battle, we find that Potter has
//accepted traitors from either of our armies, we will join forces to crush him.”

// 6912
//And Draco shot a glance filled at malice at the Boy-Who-Lived. __Take
//that, General Chaos!__

// 6913
//“I agree completely with General Malfoy,” said Granger standing beside him, her
//high voice clear and strong. “Neither of us will use traitors, and if General
//Potter does, we will wipe him off the battlefield.”

// 6914
//There was a susurration of surprise from the watching students.

// 6915
//“Very good,” said their Defense Professor, smiling. “It took the two of you
//long enough, but you are still to be congratulated on having thought of it
//before any other generals.”

// 6916
//It took a moment for this to soak in -

// 6917
//“In the future, Mr. Malfoy, Miss Granger, before you come to my office with any
//request, consider whether there is a way for you to accomplish it without my
//help. I will not deduct Quirrell points on this occasion, but next time you may
//expect to lose the full fifty.” Professor Quirrell wore an amused grin. “And
//what do you have to say about that, Mr. Potter?”

// 6918
//Harry Potter’s gaze went to Granger, then to Draco. His face appeared calm;
//though Draco was sure __controlled__ would have been the better term.

// 6919
//Finally Harry Potter spoke, his voice level. “The Chaos Legion is still happy
//to accept traitors. See you on the battlefield.”

// 6920
//Draco knew the shock was showing on his own face; there were astonished murmurs
//from the watching students, and when Draco glanced at the front row he saw that
//even Harry’s Chaotics looked taken aback.

// 6921
//Granger’s face was angry, and getting angrier. “Mr. Potter,” she said in a
//sharp tone like she thought she was a teacher, “are you __trying__ to be
//obnoxious?”

// 6922
//“Most certainly not,” Harry Potter said calmly. “I won’t make you do it every
//time. Beat me once, and I’ll stay beaten. But threats aren’t always enough,
//General of Sunshine. You did not ask me to join with you, but tried simply to
//impose your will; and sometimes you must actually defeat the enemy, to impose
//your will on him. You see, I am skeptical that Hermione Granger, the brightest
//academic star of Hogwarts, and Draco, son of Lucius, scion of the Noble and
//Most Ancient House of Malfoy, can work together to beat their common foe, Harry
//Potter.” An amused smile crossed Harry Potter’s face. “Maybe I’ll just do what
//Draco tried with Zabini, and write a letter to Lucius Malfoy and see what
//__he__ thinks about that.”

// 6923
//“__Harry!__” gasped Granger, looking absolutely aghast, and there were
//gasps from the audience as well.

// 6924
//Draco controlled the anger flushing through him. That had been a
//__stupid__ move on Harry’s part, saying that in public. If Harry had
//simply __done__ it, it might have worked, Draco hadn’t even thought about
//that, but __now__ if Father did that it would look like he was playing
//into Harry’s hands -

// 6925
//“If you think my father, Lord Malfoy, can be manipulated by __you__ that
//easily,” Draco said coldly, “you have a surprise coming, Harry Potter.”

// 6926
//And Draco realized as the words finished leaving his mouth that he’d just
//backed __his own father__ squarely into the corner, more or less without
//even meaning to. Father probably __wasn’t__ going to like this, not the
//tiniest bit, but now it would be impossible for him to say so… Draco would have
//to apologize for that, it __had __been an honest accident, but it was
//strange to think that he’d done it at all.

// 6927
//“Then go ahead and defeat the evil General Chaos,” Harry said, still looking
//amused. “I can’t win against both your armies - not if you __really__ work
//together. But I wonder if perhaps I could break you up before then.”

// 6928
//“You won’t, and we’ll __crush__ you!” said Draco Malfoy.

// 6929
//And beside him, Hermione Granger firmly nodded.

// 6930
//“Well,” said Professor Quirrell after the astounded silence had stretched for a
//while. “That was __not__ how I expected that particular conversation to
//go.” The Defense Professor had a rather intrigued expression on his face.
//“Truthfully, Mr. Potter, I expected you to concede immediately and with a
//smile, then announce that you had long since worked out my intended lesson but
//had decided not to spoil it for others. Indeed, I planned my speech
//accordingly, Mr. Potter.”

// 6931
//Harry Potter just shrugged. “Sorry about that,” he said, and said nothing more.

// 6932
//“Oh, don’t worry,” said Professor Quirrell. “This, too, will serve.”

// 6933
//And Professor Quirrell turned from the three children, and straightened at the
//podium to address the whole watching crowd; his customary air of detached
//amusement dropped away like a falling mask, and when he spoke again his voice
//was amplified louder than it had been.

// 6934
//“If not for Harry Potter,” said Professor Quirrell, his voice as crisp and cold
//as December, “You-Know-Who would have won.”

// 6935
//The silence was instant, and total.

// 6936
//“Make no mistake,” said Professor Quirrell. “The Dark Lord __was__
//winning. There were fewer and fewer Aurors who dared face him, the vigilantes
//who opposed him were being hunted down. One Dark Lord and perhaps fifty Death
//Eaters were __winning__ against a country of thousands. That is beyond
//ridiculous! There are no grades low enough for me to mark that incompetence!”

// 6937
//There was a frown on the face of Headmaster Dumbledore; and on the faces of the
//audience, puzzlement; and the utter silence went on.

// 6938
//“Do you understand now how it happened? You saw it today. I allowed traitors,
//and gave the generals no means to restrain them. You saw the result. Clever
//plots and clever betrayals, until the last soldier left on the battlefield shot
//himself! You cannot __possibly__ doubt that all three of those armies
//could have been defeated by __any__ outside foe that was unified within
//itself.”

// 6939
//Professor Quirrell leaned forward at the podium, his voice now filled with a
//grim intensity. His right hand stretched out, fingers open and spread.
//“Division is weakness,” said the Defense Professor. His hand closed into a
//tight fist. “Unity is strength. The Dark Lord understood that well, whatever
//his other follies; and he __used__ that understanding to create the one
//simple invention that made him the most terrible Dark Lord in history. Your
//parents faced one Dark Lord. And fifty Death Eaters who were perfectly unified,
//knowing that any breach of their loyalty would be punished by death, that any
//slack or incompetence would be punished by pain. None could escape the Dark
//Lord’s grasp once they took his Mark. And the Death Eaters agreed to take that
//terrible Mark because they knew that once they took it, they would be
//__united__, facing a divided land. One Dark Lord and fifty Death Eaters
//would have defeated an entire country, by the power of the Dark Mark.”

// 6940
//Professor Quirrell’s voice was bleak and hard. “Your parents __could__
//have fought back in kind. They did not. There was a man named Yermy Wibble who
//called upon the nation to institute a draft, though he did not quite have
//vision enough to propose a Mark of Britain. Yermy Wibble knew what would happen
//to him; he hoped his death would inspire others. So the Dark Lord took his
//family for good measure. Their empty skins inspired nothing but fear, and no
//one dared to speak again. And your parents would have faced the consequences of
//their despicable cowardice, if not for being saved by a one-year-old boy.”
//Professor Quirrell’s face showed full contempt. “A dramatist would have called
//that a __dei ex machina,__ for they did nothing to earn their salvation.
//He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named may not have deserved to win, but make no doubt of it,
//your parents deserved to lose.”

// 6941
//The voice of the Defense Professor rang forth like iron. “And know this: your
//parents have learned nothing! The nation is still fragmented and weak! How few
//decades passed between Grindelwald and You-Know-Who? Do you think __you__
//will not see the next threat in your own lifetimes? Will __you__ repeat
//then the follies of your parents, when you have seen the results so clearly
//laid out before you this day? For I can tell you what your parents will do,
//when the day of darkness comes! I can tell you what lesson they have learned!
//They have learned to hide like cowards and do nothing while they wait for Harry
//Potter to save them!”

// 6942
//There was a wondering look in the eyes of Headmaster Dumbledore; and other
//students gazed up at their Defense Professor with bewilderment and anger and
//awe.

// 6943
//Professor Quirrell’s eyes were as cold now as his voice. “Mark this, and mark
//it well. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named wished to rule over this country, to hold it
//in his cruel grasp forever. But at least he wished to rule over a
//__living__ country, and not a heap of ash! There have been Dark Lords who
//were mad, who wished only to make the world a vast funeral pyre! There have
//been wars in which one whole country marched against another! Your parents
//nearly lost against half a hundred, who thought to take this country alive! How
//quickly would they have been crushed by a foe more numerous than they, a foe
//that cared for nothing but their destruction? This I foretell: When the next
//threat rises, Lucius Malfoy will claim that you must follow him or perish, that
//your only hope is to trust in his cruelty and strength. And though Lucius
//Malfoy himself will believe it, this will be a lie. For when the Dark Lord
//perished, Lucius Malfoy did not unite the Death Eaters, they were shattered in
//an instant, they fled like whipped dogs and betrayed each other! Lucius Malfoy
//is not strong enough to be a true Lord, Dark or otherwise.”

// 6944
//Draco Malfoy’s fists were clenched white, there were tears in his eyes, and
//fury, and unbearable shame.

// 6945
//“No,” said Professor Quirrell, “I do not think it will be Lucius Malfoy who
//saves you. And lest you think that I speak on my own behalf, time will make
//clear soon enough that this is not so. I make you no recommendation, my
//students. But I say that if a whole country were to find a leader as strong as
//the Dark Lord, but honorable and pure, and take his Mark; then they could crush
//any Dark Lord like an insect, and all the rest of our divided magical world
//could not threaten them. And if some still greater enemy rose against us in a
//war of extermination, then only a united magical world could survive.”

// 6946
//There were gasps, mostly from Muggleborns; the students in green-trimmed robes
//looked merely puzzled. Now it was Harry Potter whose fists were clenched tight
//and trembling; and Hermione Granger beside him was angry and dismayed.

// 6947
//The Headmaster rose from his seat, his face now stern, saying no word as yet;
//but the command was clear.

// 6948
//“I do not say __what__ threat will come,” said Professor Quirrell. “But
//you will not live all your lives in peace, not if the past history of the world
//is any guide at all to its future. And if you do in the future as you have seen
//three armies do this day, if you cannot throw aside your petty bickering and
//take the Mark of a single leader, then indeed you might wish that the Dark Lord
//had lived to rule over you, and regret the day that ever Harry Potter was born
//-”

// 6949
//“__Enough!__” bellowed Albus Dumbledore.

// 6950
//There was silence.

// 6951
//Professor Quirrell slowly turned his head to gaze at where Albus Dumbledore
//stood in the fury of his wizardry; their eyes met, and a soundless stress
//pressed down like weight upon all the students, as they listened not daring to
//move.

// 6952
//“You, too, failed this country,” said Professor Quirrell. “And you know the
//peril as well as I.”

// 6953
//“Such speeches are not for the ears of students,” said Albus Dumbledore in a
//dangerously rising voice. “Nor for the mouths of professors!”

// 6954
//Dryly, then, Professor Quirrell spoke: “There were many speeches made for the
//ears of adults, as the Dark Lord rose. And the adults clapped and cheered, and
//went home having enjoyed their day’s entertainment. But I will obey you,
//Headmaster, and make no further speeches if you do not like them. My lesson is
//simple. I will go on doing nothing about traitors, and we will see what
//students can do for themselves about that, when they do not wait for professors
//to save them.”

// 6955
//And then Professor Quirrell turned back to his students, and his mouth quirked
//up in a wry grin that seemed to dissipate the dreadful pressure like a god
//blowing to scatter the clouds. “But do please be kind to the traitors up until
//now,” said Professor Quirrell. “They were just having fun.”

// 6956
//There was laughter, though it was nervous at first, and then it seemed to
//build, as Professor Quirrell stood there smiling wryly and some of the tension
//released itself.

// 6957
//Draco’s mind was still whirling through a thousand questions and a daze of
//horror, as Professor Quirrell prepared to open the envelopes in which the three
//had inscribed their wishes.

// 6958
//It had never before occurred to Draco that moon-traveling Muggles were a
//greater threat than the slow decline of wizardry, or that Father had proven
//himself too weak to stop them.

// 6959
//And even stranger, the obvious implication: Professor Quirrell believed that
//__Harry __could. The Defense Professor claimed to have made no
//recommendation, but he’d mentioned Harry Potter over and over in his speech;
//others would already be thinking the same thing as Draco.

// 6960
//It was ridiculous. The boy who had covered a stuffed chair in glitter and
//called it a throne -

// 6961
//__The boy who faced down Snape and won,__ whispered a traitorous voice,
//__that boy could grow into a Lord strong enough to rule, strong enough to
//save us all -__

// 6962
//Harry had been __raised __by Muggles! He was practically a mudblood
//himself, he wouldn’t fight against his adopted family -

// 6963
//__He knows their arts, their secrets and their methods; he can take all
//of the Muggles’ science and use it against them, alongside our own power as
//wizards.__

// 6964
//But what if he refuses? What if he’s too weak?

// 6965
//__Then,__ said that inner voice, __it will have to be you, won’t it,
//Draco Malfoy?__

// 6966
//And then there was a renewed hush from the crowd, as Professor Quirrell opened
//the first envelope.

// 6967
//“Mr. Malfoy,” said Professor Quirrell, “your wish is for… Slytherin to win the
//House Cup.”

// 6968
//There was a puzzled pause from the watching audience.

// 6969
//“Yes, Professor,” said Draco in a clear voice, knowing that it was once again
//being amplified. “If you can’t do that, then something else for Slytherin -”

// 6970
//“I will not award House points unfairly,” said Professor Quirrell. He tapped a
//cheek, looking thoughtful. “Which makes your wish difficult enough to be
//interesting. Would you like to say anything about why, Mr. Malfoy?”

// 6971
//Draco turned from the Defense Professor, gazed out at the crowd from against
//that backdrop of platinum and emeralds. Not all of Slytherin had cheered for
//Dragon Army, there were anti-Malfoy factions who had expressed that
//dissatisfaction by supporting the Boy-Who-Lived, or even Granger; and those
//factions would be encouraged greatly by what Zabini had done. He needed to
//remind them that Slytherin meant Malfoy and Malfoy meant Slytherin -

// 6972
//“No,” said Draco. “They’re Slytherins, they’ll understand.”

// 6973
//There was some laughter from the audience, especially in Slytherin, even from
//some students who would have called themselves anti-Malfoy a moment earlier.

// 6974
//Flattery was a lovely thing.

// 6975
//Draco turned back to look at Professor Quirrell again, and was surprised to see
//an embarrassed look on Granger’s face.

// 6976
//“And for Miss Granger…” said Professor Quirrell. There was the sound of a
//tearing envelope. “Your wish is for… Ravenclaw to win the House Cup?”

// 6977
//There was considerable laughter from the audience, including a chuckle from
//Draco. He hadn’t thought Granger played that game.

// 6978
//“Well, um,” said Granger, sounding like she was suddenly stumbling over a
//memorized speech, “I meant to say, that…” She took a deep breath. “There were
//soldiers from every House in my army, and I don’t mean to slight any of them.
//But Houses should still count for something, too. It was sad when students in
//the same House were hexing each other just because they were in different
//armies. People should be able to rely on whoever’s in their House. That’s why
//Godric Gryffindor, and Salazar Slytherin, and Rowena Ravenclaw, and Helga
//Hufflepuff created the four Houses of Hogwarts in the first place. I’m the
//General of Sunshine, but even before that, I’m Hermione Granger of Ravenclaw,
//and I’m proud to be part of a House that’s eight hundred years old.”

// 6979
//“Well said, Miss Granger!” said Dumbledore’s booming voice.

// 6980
//Harry Potter was frowning, and something tickled at the edge of Draco’s
//recognition.

// 6981
//“An interesting sentiment, Miss Granger,” said Professor Quirrell. “But there
//are times when it is good for a Slytherin to have friends in Ravenclaw, or for
//a Gryffindor to have friends in Hufflepuff. Surely it would be best if you
//could rely both on your friends in your House, and also your friends in your
//army?”

// 6982
//Granger’s eyes flicked briefly toward the watching students and teachers, and
//she said nothing.

// 6983
//Professor Quirrell nodded as though to himself, and then turned back to the
//podium, and took up and tore open the last envelope. Beside Draco, Harry Potter
//visibly tensed up as the Defense Professor drew forth the parchment. “And Mr.
//Potter wishes for -”

// 6984
//There was a pause as Professor Quirrell looked at the parchment.

// 6985
//Then, without any change of expression on Professor Quirrell’s face, the sheet
//of parchment burst into flames, and burned with a brief, intense fire that left
//only drifting black dust sprinkling down from his hand.

// 6986
//“Please confine yourself to the possible, Mr. Potter,” said Professor Quirrell,
//sounding very dry indeed.

// 6987
//There was a long pause; Harry, standing beside Draco, looked rather shaken.

// 6988
//__What in Merlin’s name did he ask for?__

// 6989
//“I do hope,” said Professor Quirrell, “that you prepared another wish, if I
//could not grant that one.”

// 6990
//There was another pause.

// 6991
//Harry drew a deep breath. “I didn’t,” he said, “but I already thought of
//another one.” Harry Potter turned to look out at the audience, and his voice
//firmed as he spoke. “People fear traitors because of the damage the traitor
//does directly, the soldiers they shoot or the secrets they tell. But that’s
//only part of the danger. What people do because they’re __afraid__ of
//traitors also costs them. I used that strategy today against Sunshine and
//Dragon. I didn’t tell my traitors to cause as much direct damage as possible. I
//told them to act in the way that would create the most distrust and confusion,
//and make the generals do the most costly things to try and stop them from doing
//it again. When there are just a few traitors and a whole country opposing them,
//it stands to reason that what a few traitors do might be less damaging than
//what a whole country does to stop them, that the cure might be worse than the
//disease -”

// 6992
//“Mr. Potter,” said the Defense Professor, his voice suddenly cutting, “the
//lesson of history is that you are simply wrong. Your parents’ generation did
//too little to unify themselves, not too much! This whole country almost fell,
//Mr. Potter, though you were not there to see it. I suggest that you ask your
//dorm-mates in Ravenclaw how many of them have lost family to the Dark Lord. Or
//if you are wiser, do __not__ ask! __Do__ you have a wish to make, Mr.
//Potter?”

// 6993
//“If you don’t mind,” said the mild voice of Albus Dumbledore, “I should like to
//hear what the Boy-Who-Lived has to say. He has more experience than either of
//us at stopping wars.”

// 6994
//A few people laughed, but not many.

// 6995
//Harry Potter’s gaze moved to Dumbledore, and he looked considering for a
//moment. “I’m not saying you’re wrong, Professor Quirrell. In the last war,
//people didn’t act together, and a whole country almost fell to a few dozen
//attackers, and yes, that was pathetic. And if we make the same mistake next
//time, yes, that’ll be even more pathetic. But you never fight the same war
//twice. And the problem is, the enemy is __also__ allowed to be smart. If
//you’re divided you’re vulnerable in one way; but when you try to unite, then
//you face other risks, and other costs, and the enemy will try to take advantage
//of those, too. You can’t stop thinking at just one level of the game.”

// 6996
//“Simplicity also has a great deal to commend it, Mr. Potter,” said the dry
//voice of the Defense Professor. “I do hope that you have learned something this
//day about the dangers of strategies more complicated than uniting your people
//and attacking your enemy. And if all this does not tie into your wish somehow,
//I shall be quite annoyed.”

// 6997
//“Yes,” said Harry Potter, “it was pretty difficult coming up with a wish to
//symbolize the costs of unity. But the problem of acting together isn’t just for
//wars, it’s something we have to solve all our lives, every day. If everyone is
//coordinating using the same rules, and the rules are stupid, then if
//__one__ person decides to do things differently, they’re breaking the
//rules. But if __everyone__ decides to do things differently, they can.
//It’s exactly the same problem of everyone needing to act together. But for the
//__first__ person who speaks out, it seems like they’re going against the
//crowd. And if you thought that the only important thing was that people should
//always be unified, then you could never change the game, no matter how stupid
//the rules. So my own wish, to symbolize what happens when people unite in the
//wrong direction, is that in Hogwarts we should play Quidditch without the
//Snitch.”

// 6998
//“__WHAT?__” screamed a hundred voices in the crowd, as Draco’s jaw
//dropped.

// 6999
//“The Snitch ruins the whole game,” said Harry Potter. “Everything the other
//players do ends up being irrelevant. It would make overwhelmingly more sense to
//just buy a clock. It’s one of those incredibly stupid things you don’t notice
//just because you grew up with it, that people only do because everyone else is
//doing it -”

// 7000
//But by that point Harry Potter’s voice could no longer be heard, because the
//riot had started.

// 7001
//The riot ended around fifteen seconds later, after a gigantic spout of fire
//blasted out of the highest tower of Hogwarts to the sound of a hundred
//thunders. Draco hadn’t known Dumbledore could __do__ that.

// 7002
//The students sat down again very carefully and quietly.

// 7003
//Professor Quirrell was laughing, without pause. “So be it, Mr. Potter. Your
//will be done.” The Defense Professor paused deliberately. “Of course, I only
//promised __one__ cunning plot. And that is all that the three of you will
//get.”

// 7004
//Draco had been half-expecting the words earlier, but now they still came as a
//shock; Draco exchanged rapid glances with Granger, they would have been the
//obvious allies but their wishes were directly opposed -

// 7005
//“You mean,” said Harry, “we have to all agree on a wish?”

// 7006
//“Oh, that would be __far__ too much to ask,” said Professor Quirrell. “The
//three of you have no common enemy, do you?”

// 7007
//And for one brief moment, so fast that Draco thought he might have imagined it,
//the Defense Professor’s eyes flicked in the direction of Dumbledore.

// 7008
//“No,” said Professor Quirrell, “I mean that I shall grant three wishes using a
//single plot.”

// 7009
//There was a confused silence.

// 7010
//“You can’t do that,” Harry said flatly from beside Draco. “Not even __I__
//can do that. Two of those wishes are mutually incompatible. It’s
//__logically impossible -__” and then Harry cut himself off.

// 7011
//“You’re a few years too young to tell me what I can’t do, Mr. Potter,” said
//Professor Quirrell, with a brief dry smile.

// 7012
//Then the Defense Professor turned back to the watching students. “Truthfully, I
//have no confidence in your ability to learn this day’s lesson. Go home, and
