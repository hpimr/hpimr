//== Something to Protect: Minerva McGonagall

// 19406
//The morning after had come, and all the students had gathered silently around
//the four Tables of Hogwarts, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres among them. He had
//collapsed in exhaustion last night and been awoken in the infirmary next
//morning, still muzzy, with the Philosopher’s Stone underneath his left sock.

// 19407
//The Head Table looked like a plague had swept it.

// 19408
//Dumbledore’s throne was gone from the Head Table, without replacement, leaving
//the center of the Head Table empty.

// 19409
//Severus Snape was sitting in a floating seat, the magical equivalent of a
//wheelchair.

// 19410
//Professor Sprout was missing. According to what Harry had been told last night,
//a court Legilimens would examine her to see if any further compulsions
//remained, but probably no charges would be filed. Harry had emphasized to
//Professor McGonagall and the Aurors, as hard as he could, that Professor Sprout
//was probably just a victim. The Boy-Who-Lived had pronounced that he’d seen no
//evidence of Sprout’s intentional guilt in Voldemort’s mind.

// 19411
//Professor Flitwick was missing, presumably still staying by Hermione’s side.

// 19412
//Professor Sinistra was missing and Harry didn’t know why or where.

// 19413
//The numbness that surrounded Harry’s mind was like a Mylar blanket, protective
//if not comforting. There were scenes in his mind of black robes falling and
//blood spilling, appearing for an instant before being shoved back. He’d process
//it later, not now. Some other time would be better, future-Harry would have a
//comparative advantage at coping.

// 19414
//Somewhere inside Harry was the fear that it __wouldn’t__ hurt, that there
//would be no price to be paid. But that fear also could be put off into the
//future.

// 19415
//No breakfast had appeared on the tables. The students sitting near Harry were
//waiting in frightened silence. Owls had been prohibited from entering or
//leaving Hogwarts since early last night.

// 19416
//The doors of the Great Hall opened once more, and forth came Deputy
//Headmistress Minerva McGonagall. She wore robes of formal black, and her head
//was bare, denuded of its usual witch’s hat. Her grey-brown-blonde hair was done
//up in a coiled braid, as if in preparation for a hat to be placed later; but
//for now Harry saw her head bare for the first time.

// 19417
//Minerva McGonagall came to the lectern that stood before the Head Table.

// 19418
//All eyes were upon her.

// 19419
//“I am afraid that I have much news,” Minerva said. Her voice was sad, within
//its Scottish precision. “And most of it is terrible. First. The reason I am the
//one to speak to you is that the Headmaster of Hogwarts, Albus,” her voice
//stopped, “Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, has been lost. You-Know-Who
//trapped him outside Time, and we do not know if he ever can be brought back to
//us. We, we have lost, what may have been, the greatest Headmaster, that
//Hogwarts has ever had.”

// 19420
//A susurration of horror arose across the tables, no audible gasps or moans,
//just the sound of many intaken breaths; most from Gryffindor, and some from
//Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw as well. The ill news had already been known, but now
//it had also been said by authority.

// 19421
//“Second. You-Know-Who returned briefly, but is once again dead. All that
//remained of him was his hands clutched around Miss Granger’s throat. There is
//no more threat from him, or so we think.” Minerva McGonagall drew in another
//breath. “Third. Professor Quirrell died with his wand in his hand, facing
//You-Know-Who. He was found not far from where You-Know-Who perished again, a
//victim of You-Know-Who’s Killing Curse.” Another susurration of verified
//horror, now from all four tables.

// 19422
//Minerva drew another breath. “Last night we also lost what may have been the
//greatest Defense Professor in the history of Hogwarts. His scholastic merits
//alone… Our Defense Professor has gone by many names, but his true name was
//David Monroe. As he was the last of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Monroe,
//his funeral - his second funeral, and the true one - will be held before the
//Most Ancient Hall of the Wizengamot, in two days. Yet a wake shall also be held
//for the Defense Professor of Hogwarts, for our own Professor Quirrell, in this
//castle. That man also died a Hogwarts teacher, as nobly as a Hogwarts teacher
//ever did.”

// 19423
//Harry listened in silence, shoving down the tears that again rose to his eyes.
//It wasn’t even __true,__ let alone unexpected; and yet hearing it still
//hurt. From where he sat beside, Anthony Goldstein put a comforting hand over
//Harry’s hand, and Harry left it there.

// 19424
//“Fourth. One piece of exceedingly unexpected and happy news. Hermione Granger
//is alive and in full health, sound of body and mind. Miss Granger is being
//observed at St. Mungo’s to see if there are any unexpected afteraffects from
//whatever happened to her, but she appears to be doing astonishingly well
//considering her previous condition.”

// 19425
//It should have produced wild cheers from Ravenclaw and Gryffindor, if the news
//had come as part of any other package, or if it had been more unexpected. As it
//stood, Harry saw a few smiles, but they were brief. Maybe they’d jumped for joy
//earlier, but at the moment there was only silence. Harry understood that. He
//wasn’t cheering either, not right now.

// 19426
//“Finally -” Minerva McGonagall faltered, then raised her voice. “I fear that I
//have the gravest possible news to share with some of our students. It seems
//that You-Know-Who summoned those who were once his followers; and many of them
//obeyed, whether from terribly misguided loyalty, or out of fear for their
//families if they refused. A sacrifice was required, it seems, to complete
//You-Know-Who’s resurrection; or perhaps You-Know-Who blamed his former
//followers for his defeat. Thirty-seven bodies were found, more followers
//outside Azkaban than You-Know-Who was thought to have. I am afraid -” Minerva
//McGonagall faltered again. “I am afraid that among the deceased are the parents
//of many of our students -”

// 19427
//no no no no no no NO NO NO NO

// 19428
//As though by some terrible magnet, Harry’s eyes were drawn to the picture of
//absolute horror that was Draco Malfoy’s face, even as the comforting cotton
//wrap around Harry’s thoughts was torn away like thin tissue.

// 19429
//How could he have not thought, how could he have not realised -

// 19430
//Somewhere in the background, someone was already screaming, and yet the room
//seemed very silent.

// 19431
//“Sheila, Flora, and Hestia Carrow. Lost both their parents last night. Students
//who have lost their fathers include Robert Jugson. Ethan Jugson. Sara Jugson.
//Michael MacNair. Riley and Randy Rookwood. Lily Lu. Sasha Sproch. Daniel
//Gibson. Jason Gross. Elsie Ambrose -”

// 19432
//__Maybe Lucius realised, maybe he was smart enough to stay away, maybe he
//realised that Voldemort was the one who struck at Draco -__

// 19433
//“- Theodore Nott. Vincent Crabbe. Gregory Goyle. Draco Malfoy. This concludes
//the list.”

// 19434
//One student sitting at the Gryffindor table let out a single cheer, and was
//immediately slapped by the Gryffindor witch sitting nearby hard enough that a
//Muggle would have lost teeth.

// 19435
//“Thirty points from Gryffindor and detention for the first month of next year,”
//Professor McGonagall said, her voice hard enough to break stone.

// 19436
//“__Lies!__” shrieked a tall Slytherin, who’d risen up from that table.
//”__Lies! Lies! The Dark Lord will return, and he’ll, he’ll teach you all
//the meaning of -__”

// 19437
//“Mr. Jugson,” said Severus Snape’s voice. It was also faltering, it didn’t
//sound like the Potions Master at all, it wasn’t loud and yet the Slytherin fell
//silent. “Robert. The Dark Lord killed your father.”

// 19438
//Robert Jugson let out a scream of terrific fury and turned to run out of the
//room, and Draco Malfoy folded in on himself like a collapsing house and made
//sounds that nobody heard, because the babble was starting up now.

// 19439
//Harry rose six inches from the bench and then stopped.

// 19440
//what would you say to Draco there is nothing you can say to Draco you can’t go
//over there now and pretend to be his friend

// 19441
//you want to make it right you want to make it better but you cannot make it
//right there is no way you can make right what you have done to him what you did
//to Vincent to Gregory what you did to Theodore

// 19442
//The world blurred around Harry, he barely saw Padma Patil rise up and make her
//way toward the Slytherin table and Draco, or Seamus heading towards Theodore.

// 19443
//And because Harry had read his father’s science fiction and fantasy collection,
//because he had already read this scene a dozen times over when it happened to
//other protagonists, there was an image in Harry’s mind of Mad-Eye Moody, of the
//scarred man called Alastor. And Mad-Eye’s image was saying, in just the same
//voice he’d used to speak to Albus Dumbledore in memory, that the Death Eaters
//had been pointing their wands at Harry, that they had already chosen to take
//the Dark Mark, that they had been guilty of sins beyond reckoning and maybe
//beyond Harry’s imagination, that they had foregone the deontological protection
//of good people and made themselves targetable if there was a strong reason to
//sacrifice them. That it had been necessary to save Harry’s innocent parents
//from torture and Azkaban, that it had been necessary to protect the world from
//Voldemort. That plain old ordinary Aurors and judges had to do much more
//morally questionable things than killing sworn and blooded Death Eaters who
//were pointing wands at them, in the course of carrying out ordinary justices
//that were less clear-cut but still necessary to society. If it were not right
//to do what Harry had done, if it were not right to do much __more__
//morally ambiguous things than what Harry had done, then society as human beings
//knew it could not exist. Nobody with common sense would blame Harry for doing
//it, Neville wouldn’t blame him, Professor McGonagall wouldn’t blame him,
//Dumbledore wouldn’t blame him, even Hermione would tell him it had been the
//right thing to do once she knew.

// 19444
//And all of this was true.

// 19445
//Just as it was also true that some part of Harry’s mind had calculated that
//wiping out the blood purist political elite would make it easier and more
//convenient to rebuild magical Britain afterward. It hadn’t been an important
//consideration, but it had still been calculated in those instants of rapid
//thought, a check on the long-term consequences to see if they rated as
//catastrophic, and a decision that they actually rated as pretty much okay. And
//that check had forgotten that Death Eaters had children at Hogwarts or that one
//of them wore the face of Draco’s father. It wouldn’t have changed anything. It
//wouldn’t have changed anything at all. But that was the truth of the
//calculation Harry’s mind had performed, given only seconds to think.

// 19446
//At least Harry could, if the Death Eaters’ survivors were in any sort of
//financial trouble, do something about that easily enough. Transfigure gold, and
//use the Stone to make it permanent - unless making that much gold would be
//troublesome to the wizard economy at large, or cause objections from goblins
//who didn’t understand market monetarist economics - though it wasn’t as though
//Harry didn’t also have useful services to sell -

// 19447
//Other cotton wrap was also being torn off Harry’s thoughts, now.

// 19448
//“It seems likely,” Minerva said, her voice was not loud but it cut through all
//other sounds, “that some of our students will also have been stripped last
//night of those named as their guardians. Should you end up a ward of Hogwarts,
//please know that I will take the responsibilities of my position with extreme
//seriousness. You will be extended every courtesy. Your family’s vault will be
//managed well and truly. As best I can, I will treat every one of you as I would
//my own children - and I will protect you as much as I would protect my own
//children, no more, no less. I hope that is clear to __EVERYONE AT
//HOGWARTS.__”

// 19449
//Students nodded rapidly.

// 19450
//“Good,” Minerva said. Her voice sank back. “Then there is one more thing that
//must be done.”

// 19451
//With a sad, solemn air, Professor Sinistra emerged from a side entrance. She
//was wearing white robes instead of her usual brown, and instead of her
//customary witch’s hat, she was wearing a many-tasseled square hat whose colors
//had faded into mostly gray.

// 19452
//In her hands, Professor Sinistra carried the Sorting Hat.

// 19453
//With the air of someone carrying out a ceremony that had not changed in
//centuries, Aurora Sinistra kneeled, on one knee, before Minerva McGonagall,
//presenting to her the Sorting Hat in both hands.

// 19454
//Minerva McGonagall took the Sorting Hat from Professor Sinistra’s hands, and
//placed it on her own head.

// 19455
//There was a long silence.

// 19456
//“HEADMISTRESS!”

// 19457
//“As Albus Dumbledore is not dead,” Minerva said, her voice so low that students
//strained to hear it, “but only taken from us, I accept this position in the
//capacity of Acting Headmistress only - until Dumbledore’s return.”

// 19458
//A piercing cry split the Great Hall, and Fawkes was there, overflying all Four
//Tables in a slow spiral arc. He passed over each of the tables, humming in his
//bird’s voice, a hum of absolute loyalty that would outlast the death of merely
//physical fires. __Wait,__ the hum seemed to say. __Wait until his
//return, and be true.__

// 19459
//Fawkes circled Minerva McGonagall three times, feathered wings brushing around
//her as the tears began to creep down her cheeks; then the bird flew out a
//window above the Hall, and was gone.
